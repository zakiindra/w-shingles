and various tribes including the cheyenne and arapaho 27 the united states unilaterally defined and recognized cheyenne and arapaho territory as ranging from thenorth platte riverin present-daywyomingandnebraskasouthward to thearkansas riverin present-day colorado andkansas this definition specifically encompasses the land of modern metropolitan denver but the discovery in november 1858 ofgoldin therocky mountainsin colorado 28 then part of the westernkansas territory 29 brought on agold rushand a consequent flood of white immigration across cheyenne and arapaho lands 28 colorado territorial officials pressured federal authorities to redefine and reduce the extent ofindiantreaty lands 29 in the summer of 1858 during thepikes peak gold rush a group of gold prospectors fromlawrence kansas establishedmontana cityas amining townon the banks of thesouth platte riverin what was then westernkansas territory on traditional lands ofcheyenneandarapaho this was the first historical settlement in what later became the city of denver but the site faded quickly and by the summer of 1859 it was abandoned in favor ofauraria named after the gold-mining town ofauraria georgia and st charles city 30 on november 22 1858 contradictory general william larimerand captain jonathan cox both land speculators from easternkansas territory placedcottonwoodlogs to stake a claim on the bluff overlooking the confluence of the south platte river andcherry creek across the creek from the existing mining settlement of auraria and on the site of the existing townsite of st charles larimer named the townsite denver city to curry favor with kansas territorial governorjames w denver 31 larimer hoped the towns name would help it be selected as thecounty seatofarapahoe county but unbeknownst to him governor denver had already resigned from office the location was accessible to existing trails and was across the south platte river from the site of seasonal encampments of thecheyenneandarapaho the site of these first towns is now occupied byconfluence parknear downtown denveredward w wynkoopcame to colorado in 1859 and became one of the citys founders wynkoop street in denver is named after him 32 33 larimer along with associates in the st charles city land company sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new immigrants denver city was a frontier town with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling saloons livestock and goods trading in the early years land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in auraria 31 in may 1859 denver city residents donated 53 lots to the leavenworth & pikes peak express in order to secure the regions first overland wagon route offering daily service for passengers mail freight and gold the express reached denver on a trail that trimmed westward travel time from twelve days to six in 1863western unionfurthered denvers dominance of the region by choosing the city for its regional terminus on february 18 1861 six chiefs of the southern cheyenne and four of the arapaho signed thetreaty of fort wisewith the united states 34 atbents new fortatbig timbersnear what is nowlamar colorado they ceded more than 90 percent of the lands designated for them by the fort laramie treaty including the area of modern denver 29 some cheyennes opposed to the treaty saying that it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe that the signatories had not understood what they signed and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts the territorial government of colorado however claimed the treaty was a solemn obligation and considered that those indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war 35 ten days later on february 28 1861 thecolorado territorywas created 36 arapahoe countywas formed on november 1 1861 36 and denver city was incorporated on november 7 1861 37 denver city served as the arapahoe county seat from 1861 untilconsolidationin 1902 38 in 1867 denver city

1876 colorado wasadmitted to the union this disagreement on the validity oftreaty of fort wiseescalated to bring about thecolorado warof 1864 and 1865 during which the brutalsand creek massacreagainstcheyenneandarapahopeoples occurred the aftermath of the war was the dissolution of the reservation in eastern colorado the signing ofmedicine lodge treatywhich stipulated that thecheyenneandarapahopeoples would be relocated outside of their traditional territory this treaty term was achieved even though the treaty was not legally ratified by the tribal members as per the

straightforwardstreet gridoriented to the fourcardinal directions blocks are usually identified in hundreds from the median streets identified as 00 which are broadway the east–west median running north–south and ellsworth avenue the north–south median running east–west colfax avenue a major east–west artery through denver is 15 blocks 1500 north of the median avenues north of ellsworth are numbered with the exception of colfax avenue and several others such as martin luther king jr blvd and montview blvd while avenues south of ellsworth are named there is also an older downtown grid system that was designed to be parallel to the confluence of thesouth platte riverandcherry creek most of the streets downtown and inlodorun northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast this system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal if the streets were in a normal n–s e–w grid only the n–s streets would receive sunlight with the grid oriented to the diagonal directions the nw–se streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the ne–sw streets receive it in the afternoon this idea was from henry brown the founder of thebrown palace hotel there is now a plaque across the street from thebrown palace hotelthat honors this idea the nw–se streets are numbered while the ne–sw streets are named the named streets start at the intersection of colfax avenue and broadway with the block-long cheyenne place the numbered streets start underneath the colfax and i-25 viaducts there are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid there are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid such as park avenue morrison road and speer boulevard larimer street named afterwilliam larimer jr the founder of denver which is in the heart oflodo is the oldest street in denver all roads in the downtown grid system are streets eg.16th street stout street except for the five ne–sw roads nearest the intersection of colfax avenue and broadway cheyenne place cleveland place court place tremont place and glenarm place roads outside that system that travel east–west are designated avenues and those that travel north–south are designated streets eg colfax avenue lincoln street boulevards are higher capacity streets and travel any direction more commonly north and south smaller roads are sometimes referred to as places drives though not all drives are smaller capacity roads some are major thoroughfares or courts most streets outside the area between broadway and colorado boulevard are organized alphabetically from the citys center east of colorado boulevard the naming convention of streets takes on a predictable pattern of going through the alphabet by using each letter twice ie aa bb cc dd through yy – there is no z the first street is almost always named after a plant or fruit the second street is almost always named after a foreign place or location for example jersey street jasmine street quebec street quince street and syracuse street spruce street inexplicably the letter y only has one street yosemite and there is no z this double-alphabet naming convention continues in some form into aurora colorado some denver streets havebicycle lanes leaving a patchwork of disjointed routes throughout the city there are over 850 miles 1370 km 180 of paved off-road bike paths in denver parks and along bodies of water like cherry creek and the south platte this allows for a significant portion of denvers population to be bicycle commuters and has led to denver being known as a bicycle-friendly city 181 some residents strongly
