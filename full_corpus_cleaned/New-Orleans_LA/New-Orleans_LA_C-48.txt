the 2020 census it is the most populous city in louisiana and the french louisiana region the second-most populous in the deep south and the twelfth-most populous in the southeastern united states the city is coextensive with orleans parish new orleans serves as a major port and a commercial hub for the broader gulf coast region it also anchors the new orleans metropolitan area which had a

creole cuisine unique dialects and its annual celebrations and festivals most notably mardi gras the historic heart of the city is the french quarter known for its french and spanish creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along bourbon street the city has been described as the most unique in the united states owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage additionally new orleans has increasingly been known as hollywood south due to its prominent role in the film industry and in pop culture founded in 1718 by french colonists new orleans was once the territorial capital of french louisiana before becoming part of the united states in the louisiana purchase of 1803 new orleans in 1840 was the third most populous city in the united states and it was the largest city in the american south from the antebellum era until after world war ii the city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding due to its high rainfall low lying elevation poor natural drainage and proximity to multiple bodies of water state and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city new orleans was severely affected by hurricane katrina in late august 2005 which flooded more than 80% of the city killed more than 1800 people and displaced thousands of residents causing a population decline of over 50% since katrina major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the citys population concerns have been expressed about gentrification new residents buying property in formerly close-knit communities and displacement of longtime residents additionally high rates of violent crime continue to plague the city with new orleans experiencing 280 murders in 2022 resulting in the highest per capita homicide rate in the united states etymology and nicknames before the arrival of european colonists the indigenous choctaw people called the area of present-day new orleans bulbancha which translates as land of many tongues it appears to have been a contraction of balbáha a̱shah which means there are foreign speakers in his book histoire de la louisiane antoine-simon le page du pratz wrote that the indigenous name referred to the mississippi river and that the use of the same name for the settlement relates to native american concepts of the close interaction between rivers and their surrounding land the name of new orleans derives from the original french name la nouvelle-orléans which was given to the city in honor of philippe ii duke of orléans who served as louis xv s regent from 1715 to 1723 the french city of orléans itself is named after the roman emperor aurelian originally being known as aurelianum thus by extension since new orleans is also named after aurelian its name in latin would translate to nova aurelia following the defeat in the seven years war france formally transferred the possession of louisiana to spain with which france had secretly signed the treaty of fontainebleau a year earlier in the treaty of paris of 1763 the spanish renamed the city nueva orleans pronounced ˌnweβa oɾleˈans which was used until 1800 the united states which had acquired possession from france in 1803 adopted the french name and anglicized it to new orleans new orleans has several nicknames including these - crescent city alluding to the course of the lower mississippi river around and through the city - the big easy possibly a reference by musicians in the early 20th century to the relative ease of finding work there - the city that care forgot used since at least 1938 referring to the outwardly easygoing carefree nature of the residents - nola the acronym for new orleans louisiana history french–spanish colonial era la nouvelle-orléans new orleans was founded in the spring of 1718 may 7 has become the traditional date to mark the anniversary but the actual day is unknown by the french mississippi company under the direction of jean-baptiste le moyne de bienville on land inhabited by the chitimacha it was named for philippe ii duke of orléans who was regent of the kingdom of france at the time his title came from the french city of orléans as a french colony louisiana faced struggles with numerous native american tribes who were navigating the competing interests of france spain and england as well as traditional rivals notably the natchez whose traditional lands were along the mississippi near the modern city of natchez mississippi had a series of wars culminating in the natchez revolt that began in 1729 with the natchez overrunning fort rosalie approximately 230 french colonists were killed and the natchez settlement destroyed causing fear and concern in new orleans and the rest of the territory in retaliation then-governor étienne perier launched a campaign to completely destroy the natchez nation and its native allies by 1731 the natchez people had been killed enslaved or dispersed among other tribes but the campaign soured relations between france and the territorys native americans leading directly into the chickasaw wars of the 1730s relations with louisianas native american population remained a concern into the 1740s for governor marquis de vaudreuil in the early 1740s traders from the thirteen colonies crossed into the appalachian mountains the native american tribes would now operate dependent on which of various european colonists would most benefit them several of these tribes and especially the chickasaw and choctaw would trade goods and gifts for their loyalty the economic issue in the colony which continued under vaudreuil resulted in many raids by native american tribes taking advantage of the french weakness in 1747 and 1748 the chickasaw would raid along the east bank of the mississippi all the way south to baton rouge these raids would often force residents of french louisiana to take refuge in new orleans proper citation needed inability to find labor was the most pressing issue in the young colony the colonists turned to sub-saharan african slaves to make their investments in louisiana profitable in the late 1710s the transatlantic slave trade imported enslaved africans into the colony this led to the biggest shipment in 1716 where several trading ships appeared with slaves as cargo to the local residents in a one-year span by 1724 the large number of blacks in louisiana prompted the institutionalizing of laws governing slavery within the colony these laws required that slaves be baptized in the roman catholic faith slaves be married in the church the slave law formed in the 1720s is known as the code noir which would bleed into the antebellum period of the american south as well louisiana slave culture had its own distinct afro-creole society that called on past cultures and the situation for slaves in the new world afro-creole was present in religious beliefs and the louisiana creole language the religion most associated with this period was called voodoo in the city of new orleans an inspiring mixture of foreign influences created a melting pot of culture that is still celebrated today by the end of french colonization in louisiana new orleans was recognized commercially in the atlantic world its inhabitants traded across the french commercial system new orleans was a hub for this trade both physically and culturally because it served as the exit point to the rest of the globe for the interior of the north american continent in one instance the french government established a chapter house of sisters in new orleans the ursuline sisters after being sponsored by the company of the indies founded a convent in the city in 1727 at the end of the colonial era the ursuline academy maintained a house of 70 boarding and 100 day students today numerous schools in new orleans can trace their lineage from this academy citation needed another notable example is the street plan and architecture still distinguishing new orleans today french louisiana had early architects in the province who were trained as military engineers and were now assigned to design government buildings pierre le blond de tour and adrien de pauger for example planned many early fortifications along with the street plan for the city of new orleans after them in the 1740s ignace françois broutin as engineer-in-chief of louisiana reworked the architecture of new orleans with an extensive public works program french policy-makers in paris attempted to set political and economic norms for new orleans the city acted autonomously in much of its cultural and physical aspects but stayed in communication with the foreign trends as well citation needed the french colony of louisiana was ceded to the spanish empire in the 1763 treaty of paris following frances defeat by great britain in the seven years war after the french relinquished west louisiana to the spanish new orleans merchants attempted to ignore spanish rule and even re-institute french control on the colony the citizens of new orleans held a series of public meetings during 1765 to keep the populace in opposition of the establishment of spanish rule anti-spanish passions in new orleans reached their highest level after two years of spanish administration in louisiana on october 27 1768 a mob of local residents spiked the guns guarding new orleans and took control of the city from the spanish the rebellion organized a group to sail for paris where it met with officials of the french government this group brought with them a long memorial to summarize the abuses the colony had endured from the spanish king louis xv and his ministers reaffirmed spains sovereignty over louisiana nearly all of the surviving 18th-century architecture of the vieux carré french quarter dates from the spanish period notably excepting the old ursuline convent during the american revolutionary war new orleans was an important port for smuggling aid to the american revolutionaries and transporting military equipment and supplies up the mississippi river beginning in the 1760s filipinos began to settle in and around new orleans bernardo de gálvez y madrid count of gálvez successfully directed a southern campaign against the british from the city in 1779 united states territorial era the third treaty of san ildefonso in 1800 restored french control of new orleans and louisiana but napoleon sold both to the united states in the louisiana purchase in 1803 thereafter the city grew rapidly with influxes of americans french creoles and africans later immigrants were irish germans poles and italians major commodity crops of sugar and cotton were cultivated with slave labor on nearby large plantations between 1791 and 1810 thousands of st dominican refugees from the haitian revolution both whites and free people of color affranchis or gens de couleur libres arrived in new orleans a number brought their slaves with them many of whom were native africans or of full-blood descent while governor claiborne and other officials wanted to keep out additional free black people the french creoles wanted to increase the french-speaking population in addition to bolstering the territorys french-speaking population these refugees had a significant impact on the culture of louisiana including developing its sugar industry and cultural institutions as more refugees were allowed into the territory of orleans st dominican refugees who had first gone to cuba also arrived many of the white francophones had been deported by officials in cuba in 1809 as retaliation for bonapartist schemes nearly 90 percent of these immigrants settled in new orleans the 1809 migration brought 2731 whites 3102 free people of color of mixed-race european and african descent and 3226 slaves of primarily african descent doubling the citys population the city became 63 percent black a greater proportion than charleston south carolina s 53 percent at that time slave rebellion on january 8–11 1811 about 500 enslaved africans in st charles and st john the baptist parishes rose up in the german coast rebellion against their enslavers killing two white men in the process they proceeded to march south toward new orleans and were eventually controlled by the local militia with numerous casualties on both sides the uprising has been called the largest slave rebellion in us history battle of new orleans during the final campaign of the war of 1812 the british sent a force of 11000 in an attempt to capture new orleans despite great challenges general andrew jackson with support from the us navy successfully cobbled together a force of militia from louisiana and mississippi us army regulars a large contingent of tennessee state militia kentucky frontiersmen and local privateers the latter led by the pirate jean lafitte to decisively defeat the british led by sir edward pakenham in the battle of new orleans on january 8 1815 the armies had not learned of the treaty of ghent which had been signed on december 24 1814 however the treaty did not call for cessation of hostilities until after both governments had ratified it the us government ratified it on february 16 1815 the fighting in louisiana began in december 1814 and did not end until late january after the americans held off the royal navy during a ten-day siege of fort st philip the royal navy went on to capture fort bowyer near mobile before the commanders received news of the peace treaty port of new orleans as a port new orleans played a major role during the antebellum period in the atlantic slave trade the port handled commodities for export from the interior and imported goods from other countries which were warehoused and transferred in new orleans to smaller vessels and distributed along the mississippi river watershed the river was filled with steamboats flatboats and sailing ships despite its role in the slave trade new orleans at the time also had the largest and most prosperous community of free persons of color in the nation who were often educated middle-class property owners dwarfing the other cities in the antebellum south new orleans had the us largest slave market the market expanded after the united states ended the international trade in 1808 two-thirds of the more than one million slaves brought to the deep south arrived via forced migration in the domestic slave trade the money generated by the sale of slaves in the upper south has been estimated at 15 percent of the value of the staple crop economy the slaves were collectively valued at half a billion dollars the trade spawned an ancillary economy—transportation housing and clothing fees etc estimated at 13.5 percent of the price per person amounting to tens of billions of dollars 2005 dollars adjusted for inflation during the antebellum period with new orleans as a prime beneficiary according to historian paul lachance after the louisiana purchase numerous anglo-americans migrated to the city the population doubled in the 1830s and by 1840 new orleans had become the nations wealthiest and the third-most populous city after new york and baltimore german and irish immigrants began arriving in the 1840s working as port laborers in this period the state legislature passed more restrictions on manumissions of slaves and virtually ended it in 1852 in the 1850s white francophones remained an intact and vibrant community in new orleans they maintained instruction in french in two of the citys four school districts all served white students in 1860 the city had 13000 free people of color gens de couleur libres the class of free mostly mixed-race people that expanded in number during french and spanish rule they set up some private schools for their children the census recorded 81 percent of the free people of color as mulatto a term used to cover all degrees of mixed race page needed mostly part of the francophone group they constituted the artisan educated and professional class of african americans the mass of blacks were still enslaved working at the port in domestic service in crafts and mostly on the many large surrounding sugarcane plantations throughout new orleans history until the early 20th century when medical and scientific advances ameliorated the situation the city suffered repeated epidemics of yellow fever and other tropical and infectious diseases in the first half of the 19th century yellow fever epidemics killed over 150000 people in new orleans after growing by 45 percent in the 1850s by 1860 the city had nearly 170000 people it had grown in wealth with a per capita income that was second in the nation and the highest in the south the city had a role as the primary commercial gateway for the nations booming midsection the port was the nations third largest in terms of tonnage of imported goods after boston and new york handling 659000 tons in 1859 civil war–reconstruction era as the creole elite feared the american civil war changed their world in april 1862 following the citys occupation by the union navy after the battle of forts jackson and st philip gen benjamin f butler – a respected massachusetts lawyer serving in that states militia – was appointed military governor new orleans residents supportive of the confederacy nicknamed him beast butler because of an order he issued after his troops had been assaulted and harassed in the streets by women still loyal to the confederate cause his order warned that such future occurrences would result in his men treating such women as those plying their avocation in the streets implying that they would treat the women like prostitutes accounts of this spread widely he also came to be called spoons butler because of the alleged looting that his troops did while occupying the city during which time he himself supposedly pilfered silver flatware significantly butler abolished french-language instruction in city schools statewide measures in 1864 and after the war 1868 further strengthened the english-only policy imposed by federal representatives with the predominance of english speakers that language had already become dominant in business and government by the end of the 19th century french usage had faded it was also under pressure from irish italian and german immigrants however as late as 1902 one-fourth of the population of the city spoke french in ordinary daily intercourse while another two-fourths was able to understand the language perfectly and as late as 1945 many elderly creole women spoke no english the last major french language newspaper labeille de la nouvelle-orléans new orleans bee ceased publication on december 27 1923 after 96 years according to some sources le courrier de la nouvelle orléans continued until 1955 as the city was captured and occupied early in the war it was spared the destruction through warfare suffered by many other cities of the american south the union army eventually extended its control north along the mississippi river and along the coastal areas as a result most of the southern portion of louisiana was originally exempted from the liberating provisions of the 1863 emancipation proclamation issued by president abraham lincoln large numbers of rural ex-slaves and some free people of color from the city volunteered for the first regiments of black troops in the war led by brigadier general daniel ullman 1810–1892 of the 78th regiment of new york state volunteers militia they were known as the corps dafrique while that name had been used by a militia before the war that group was composed of free people of color the new group was made up mostly of former slaves they were supplemented in the last two years of the war by newly organized united states colored troops who played an increasingly important part in the war violence throughout the south especially the memphis riots of 1866 followed by the new orleans riot in the same year led congress to pass the reconstruction act and the fourteenth amendment extending the protections of full citizenship to freedmen and free people of color louisiana and texas were put under the authority of the fifth military district of the united states during reconstruction louisiana was readmitted to the union in 1868 its constitution of 1868 granted universal male suffrage and established universal public education both blacks and whites were elected to local and state offices in 1872 lieutenant governor pbs pinchback who was of mixed race succeeded henry clay warmouth for a brief period as republican governor of louisiana becoming the first governor of african descent of a us state the next african american to serve as governor of a us state was douglas wilder elected in virginia in 1989 new orleans operated a racially integrated public school system during this period wartime damage to levees and cities along the mississippi river adversely affected southern crops and trade the federal government contributed to restoring infrastructure the nationwide financial recession and panic of 1873 adversely affected businesses and slowed economic recovery from 1868 elections in louisiana were marked by violence as white insurgents tried to suppress black voting and disrupt republican party gatherings the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election resulted in conflicts that ran for years the white league an insurgent paramilitary group that supported the democratic party was organized in 1874 and operated in the open violently suppressing the black vote and running off republican officeholders in 1874 in the battle of liberty place 5000 members of the white league fought with city police to take over the state offices for the democratic candidate for governor holding them for three days by 1876 such tactics resulted in the white democrats the so-called redeemers regaining political control of the state legislature the federal government gave up and withdrew its troops in 1877 ending reconstruction in 1892 the racially integrated unions of new orleans led a general strike in the city from november 8 to 12 shutting down the city & winning the vast majority of their demands jim crow era dixiecrats passed jim crow laws establishing racial segregation in public facilities in 1889 the legislature passed a constitutional amendment incorporating a grandfather clause that effectively disfranchised freedmen as well as the propertied people of color manumitted before the war unable to vote african americans could not serve on juries or in local office and were closed out of formal politics for generations the southern us was ruled by a white democratic party public schools were racially segregated and remained so until 1960 new orleans large community of well-educated often french-speaking free persons of color gens de couleur libres who had been free prior to the civil war fought against jim crow they organized the comité des citoyens citizens committee to work for civil rights as part of their legal campaign they recruited one of their own homer plessy to test whether louisianas newly enacted separate car act was constitutional plessy boarded a commuter train departing new orleans for covington louisiana sat in the car reserved for whites only and was arrested the case resulting from this incident plessy v ferguson was heard by the us supreme court in 1896 the court ruled that separate but equal accommodations were constitutional effectively upholding jim crow measures in practice african american public schools and facilities were underfunded across the south the supreme court ruling contributed to this period as the nadir of race relations in the united states the rate of lynchings of black men was high across the south as other states also disfranchised blacks and sought to impose jim crow nativist prejudices also surfaced anti-italian sentiment in 1891 contributed to the lynchings of 11 italians some of whom had been acquitted of the murder of the police chief some were shot and killed in the jail where they were detained it was the largest mass lynching in us history in july 1900 the city was swept by white mobs rioting after robert charles a young african american killed a policeman and temporarily escaped the mob killed him and an estimated 20 other blacks seven whites died in the days-long conflict until a state militia suppressed it 20th century new orleans economic and population zenith in relation to other american cities occurred in the antebellum period it was the nations fifth-largest city in 1860 after new york philadelphia boston and baltimore and was significantly larger than all other southern cities from the mid-19th century onward rapid economic growth shifted to other areas while new orleans relative importance steadily declined the growth of railways and highways decreased river traffic diverting goods to other transportation corridors and markets thousands of the most ambitious people of color left the state in the great migration around world war ii and after many for west coast destinations from the late 1800s most censuses recorded new orleans slipping down the ranks in the list of largest american cities new orleans population still continued to increase throughout the period but at a slower rate than before the civil war in 1929 the new orleans streetcar strike during which serious unrest occurred it is also credited for the creation of the distinctly louisianan po boy sandwich by the mid-20th century new orleanians recognized that their city was no longer the leading urban area in the south by 1950 houston dallas and atlanta exceeded new orleans in size and in 1960 miami eclipsed new orleans even as the latters population reached its historic peak as with other older american cities highway construction and suburban development drew residents from the center city to newer housing outside the 1970 census recorded the first absolute decline in population since the city became part of the united states in 1803 the greater new orleans metropolitan area continued expanding in population albeit more slowly than other major sun belt cities while the port remained one of the nations largest automation and containerization cost many jobs the citys former role as banker to the south was supplanted by larger peer cities new orleans economy had always been based more on trade and financial services than on manufacturing but the citys relatively small manufacturing sector also shrank after world war ii despite some economic development successes under the administrations of delesseps chep morrison 1946–1961 and victor vic schiro 1961–1970 metropolitan new orleans growth rate consistently lagged behind more vigorous cities civil rights movement during the later years of morrisons administration and for the entirety of schiros the city was a center of the civil rights movement the southern christian leadership conference was founded in new orleans and lunch counter sit-ins were held in canal street department stores a prominent and violent series of confrontations occurred in 1960 when the city attempted school desegregation following the supreme court ruling in brown v board of education 1954 when six-year-old ruby bridges integrated william frantz elementary school in the ninth ward she was the first child of color to attend a previously all-white school in the south much controversy preceded the 1956 sugar bowl at tulane stadium when the pitt panthers with african-american fullback bobby grier on the roster met the georgia tech yellow jackets there had been controversy over whether grier should be allowed to play due to his race and whether georgia tech should even play at all due to georgias governor marvin griffin s opposition to racial integration after griffin publicly sent a telegram to the states board of regents requesting georgia tech not to engage in racially integrated events georgia techs president blake r van leer rejected the request and threatened to resign the game went on as planned the civil rights movements success in gaining federal passage of the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965 renewed constitutional rights including voting for blacks together these resulted in the most far-reaching changes in new orleans 20th century history though legal and civil equality were re-established by the end of the 1960s a large gap in income levels and educational attainment persisted between the citys white and african american communities as the middle class and wealthier members of both races left the center city its populations income level dropped and it became proportionately more african american from 1980 the african american majority elected primarily officials from its own community they struggled to narrow the gap by creating conditions conducive to the economic uplift of the african american community new orleans became increasingly dependent on tourism as an economic mainstay during the administrations of sidney barthelemy 1986–1994 and marc morial 1994–2002 relatively low levels of educational attainment high rates of household poverty and rising crime threatened the citys prosperity in the later decades of the century the negative effects of these socioeconomic conditions aligned poorly with the changes in the late-20th century to the economy of the united states which reflected a post-industrial knowledge-based paradigm in which mental skills and education were more important to advancement than manual skills drainage and flood control in the 20th century new orleans government and business leaders believed they needed to drain and develop outlying areas to provide for the citys expansion the most ambitious development during this period was a drainage plan devised by engineer and inventor a baldwin wood designed to break the surrounding swamps stranglehold on the citys geographic expansion until then urban development in new orleans was largely limited to higher ground along the natural river levees and bayous woods pump system allowed the city to drain huge tracts of swamp and marshland and expand into low-lying areas over the 20th century rapid subsidence both natural and human-induced resulted in these newly populated areas subsiding to several feet below sea level new orleans was vulnerable to flooding even before the citys footprint departed from the natural high ground near the mississippi river in the late 20th century however scientists and new orleans residents gradually became aware of the citys increased vulnerability in 1965 flooding from hurricane betsy killed dozens of residents although the majority of the city remained dry the rain-induced flood of may 8 1995 demonstrated the weakness of the pumping system after that event measures were undertaken to dramatically upgrade pumping capacity by the 1980s and 1990s scientists observed that extensive rapid and ongoing erosion of the marshlands and swamp surrounding new orleans especially that related to the mississippi river–gulf outlet canal had the unintended result of leaving the city more vulnerable than before to hurricane-induced catastrophic storm surges citation needed 21st century hurricane katrina new orleans was catastrophically affected by what raymond b seed called the worst engineering disaster in the world since chernobyl when the federal levee system failed during hurricane katrina on august 29 2005 by the time the hurricane approached the city on august 29 2005 most residents had evacuated as the hurricane passed through the gulf coast region that day the citys federal flood protection system failed resulting in the worst civil engineering disaster in american history at the time floodwalls and levees constructed by the united states army corps of engineers failed below design specifications and 80% of the city flooded tens of thousands of residents who had remained were rescued or otherwise made their way to shelters of last resort at the louisiana superdome or the new orleans morial convention center more than 1500 people were recorded as having died in louisiana most in new orleans while others remain unaccounted for before hurricane katrina the city called for the first mandatory evacuation in its history to be followed by another mandatory evacuation three years later with hurricane gustav hurricane rita the city was declared off-limits to residents while efforts to clean up after hurricane katrina began the approach of hurricane rita in september 2005 caused repopulation efforts to be postponed and the lower ninth ward was reflooded by ritas storm surge post-disaster recovery because of the scale of damage many people resettled permanently outside the area federal state and local efforts supported recovery and rebuilding in severely damaged neighborhoods the us census bureau in july 2006 estimated the population to be 223000 a subsequent study estimated that 32000 additional residents had moved to the city as of march 2007 bringing the estimated population to 255000 approximately 56% of the pre-katrina population level another estimate based on utility usage from july 2007 estimated the population to be approximately 274000 or 60% of the pre-katrina population these estimates are somewhat smaller to a third estimate based on mail delivery records from the greater new orleans community data center in june 2007 which indicated that the city had regained approximately two-thirds of its pre-katrina population in 2008 the us census bureau revised its population estimate for the city upward to 336644 most recently by july 2015 the population was back up to 386617—80% of what it was in 2000 several major tourist events and other forms of revenue for the city have returned large conventions returned college bowl games returned for the 2006–2007 season the new orleans saints returned that season the new orleans hornets now named the pelicans returned to the city for the 2007–2008 season new orleans hosted the 2008 nba all-star game in addition to super bowl xlvii major annual events such as mardi gras voodoo experience and the jazz & heritage festival were never displaced or canceled a new annual festival the running of the bulls new orleans was created in 2007 hurricane ida on august 29 2021 coincidentally the 16th anniversary of the landfall of hurricane katrina hurricane ida a category 4 hurricane made landfall near port fourchon where the hurricane ida tornado outbreak caused damage truck attack on january 1 2025 a truck attack occurred in new orleans killing 15 people and injuring 35 the attack was carried out as an act of domestic terrorism and was committed by shamsud-din jabbar geography new orleans is located in the mississippi river delta south of lake pontchartrain on the banks of the mississippi river approximately 105 miles 169 km upriver from the gulf of mexico according to the us census bureau the citys area is 350 square miles 910 km 2 of which 169 square miles 440 km 2 is land and 181 square miles 470 km 2 52% is water the area along the river is characterized by ridges and hollows elevation new orleans was originally settled on the rivers natural levees or high ground after the flood control act of 1965 the us army corps of engineers built floodwalls and man-made levees around a much larger geographic footprint that included previous marshland and swamp over time pumping of water from marshland allowed for development into lower elevation areas today half of the city is at or below local mean sea level while the other half is slightly above sea level evidence suggests that portions of the city may be dropping in elevation due to subsidence a 2007 study by tulane and xavier university suggested that 51% of the contiguous urbanized portions of orleans jefferson and st bernard parishes lie at or above sea level with the more densely populated areas generally on higher ground the average elevation of the city is currently between 1 and 2 feet 0.30 and 0.61 m below sea level with some portions of the city as high as 20 feet 6 m at the base of the river levee in uptown and others as low as 7 feet 2 m below sea level in the farthest reaches of eastern new orleans a study published by the asce journal of hydrologic engineering in 2016 however stated the magnitude of subsidence potentially caused by the draining of natural marsh in the new orleans area and southeast louisiana is a topic of debate a study published in geology in 2006 by an associate professor at tulane university claims the study noted however that the results did not necessarily apply to the mississippi river delta nor the new orleans metropolitan area proper on the other hand a report by the american society of civil engineers claims that new orleans is subsiding sinking in may 2016 nasa published a study which suggested that most areas were in fact experiencing subsidence at a highly variable rate which was generally consistent with but somewhat higher than previous studies cityscape the central business district is located immediately north and west of the mississippi and was historically called the american quarter or american sector it was developed after the heart of french and spanish settlement it includes lafayette square most streets in this area fan out from a central point major streets include canal street poydras street tulane avenue and loyola avenue canal street divides the traditional downtown area from the uptown area every street crossing canal street between the mississippi river and rampart street which is the northern edge of the french quarter has a different name for the uptown and downtown portions for example st charles avenue known for its street car line is

national historical park - vieux carre historic district government the city of new orleans is a political subdivision of the us state of louisiana the city and the parish of orleans operate as a merged city-parish government the original city was composed of what are now the 1st through 9th wards the city of lafayette including the garden district was added in 1852 as the 10th and 11th wards in 1870 jefferson city including faubourg bouligny and much of the audubon and university areas was annexed as the 12th 13th and 14th wards algiers on the west bank of the mississippi was also annexed in 1870 becoming the 15th ward new orleans has a mayor-council government following a home rule charter adopted in 1954 as later amended the city council consists of seven members five elected from single-member districts and two members elected at-large that is across the city-parish latoya cantrell assumed the mayors office in 2018 as the first female mayor of the city an ordinance in 2006 established an office of inspector general to review city government activities new orleans government is largely centralized in the city council and mayors office but it maintains earlier systems from when various sections of the city managed their affairs separately for example new orleans had seven elected tax assessors each with their own staff representing various districts of the city rather than one centralized office a constitutional amendment passed on november 7 2006 consolidated the seven assessors into one in 2010 the city of new orleans used archon information systems software and services to host multiple online tax sales the first tax sale was held after hurricane katrina the new orleans government operates both a fire department and the new orleans emergency medical services new orleans is the only city in louisiana that refuses to pay court-ordered judgments when it loses a case that were awarded to the other party the city uses a provision in the louisiana constitution that prohibits the seizure of a citys property to pay a judgment when it loses a lawsuit according to an article the constitution says the funds cant be seized and can only be paid out if the government appropriates the money in other words if the city of new orleans doesnt budget the funds for judgments no judge can force the city to pay only if the city council chooses to vote to pay a judgment can the other party be paid since the city cannot be forced to pay judgments unless it chooses to do so it simply does not pay more than $36 million in over 500 unpaid judgments issued against the city are simply ignored some going as far back as 1996 the orleans parish civil sheriffs office serves papers involving lawsuits provides court security and operates the citys correctional facilities including orleans parish prison the sheriffs office shares legal jurisdiction with the new orleans police department and provides it with backup on an as-needed basis before 2010 new orleans and all other parishes in louisiana had separate criminal and civil sheriffs offices corresponding to the separate criminal and civil courts these were merged in 2010 by louisiana revised statute 331500 as of 2024 update the sheriff is susan hutson who defeated 17-year incumbent marlin gusman in the 2021 new orleans city election crime crime is a notable ongoing problem in new

exclusively black males from lower income neighborhoods in 2011 97% were black and 95% were male 91% of victims were black as well the citys murder rate has been historically high and consistently among the highest rates nationwide since the 1970s from 1994 to 2013 new orleans was the countrys murder capital annually averaging over 200 murders the first record was broken in 1979 when the city reached 242 homicides the record was broken again reaching 250 by 1989 to 345 by the end of 1991 by 1993 new orleans had 395 murders 80.5 for every 100000 residents in 1994 the city was officially

baltimore in 1999 the citys murder rate dropped down to a low of 158 and climbed to the high 200s in the early 2000s between 2000 and 2004 new orleans had the highest homicide rate per capita of any city in the us with 59 people killed per year per 100000 citizens in 2006 with nearly half the population gone and widespread disruption and dislocation because of deaths and refugee relocations from hurricane katrina the city hit another record of homicides it was ranked as the most dangerous city in the country by 2009 there was a 17% decrease in violent crime a decrease seen in other cities across the country but the homicide rate remained among the highest in the united states at between 55 and 64 per 100000 residents in 2010 new orleans homicide rate dropped to 49.1 per 100000 but increased again in 2012 to 53.2 the highest rate among cities of 250000 population or larger the violent crime rate is a key issue in every modern mayoral race in january 2007 several thousand new orleans residents marched to city hall for a rally demanding police and city leaders tackle the crime problem then-mayor ray nagin said he was totally and solely focused on addressing the problem later the city implemented checkpoints during late night hours in problem areas the murder rate climbed 14% in 2011 to 57.88 per 100000 rising to no 21 in the world in 2016 according to annual crime statistics released by the new orleans police department nopd 176 were murdered in 2017 new orleans had the highest rate of gun violence surpassing the more populated chicago and detroit in 2020 murders increased 68% from 2019 with a total of 202 murders criminal justice observers blamed impacts from covid-19 and changes in police strategies for the uptick in 2022 new orleans homicide rate skyrocketed leading every major city hence the city again being declared as the murder capital of america the 2022 city homicide count increased to 280 which was a 26-year high the nopd dropped to under 1000 officers in 2022 which meant the department was severely understaffed for the citys population nopd is actively working to reduce violent crime by offering attractive incentives to recruit and retain more officers education colleges and universities new orleans has the highest concentration of colleges and universities in louisiana and one of the highest in the southern united states

parish school board opsb also known as new orleans public schools nops is the public school district for the entire city katrina was a watershed moment for the school system pre-katrina nops was one of the areas largest systems along with the jefferson parish public school system it was also the lowest-performing school district in louisiana according to researchers carl l bankston and stephen j caldas only 12 of the 103 public schools within the city limits showed reasonably good performance following hurricane katrina the state of louisiana took over most of the schools within the system all schools that matched a nominal worst-performing metric many of these schools and others were subsequently granted operating charters giving them administrative independence from the orleans parish school board the recovery school district or the louisiana board of elementary and secondary education bese at the start of the 2014 school year all public school students in the nops system attended these independent public charter schools the nations first to do so the charter schools made significant and sustained gains in student achievement led by outside operators such as kipp the algiers charter school network and the capital one–university of new orleans charter school network an october 2009 assessment demonstrated continued growth in the academic performance of public schools considering the scores of all public schools in new orleans gives an overall school district performance score of 70.6 this score represents a 24% improvement over an equivalent pre-katrina 2004 metric when a district score of 56.9 was posted notably this score of 70.6 approaches the score 78.4 posted in 2009 by the adjacent suburban jefferson parish public school system though that systems performance score is itself below the state average of 91 one particular change was that parents could choose which school to enroll their children in rather than attending the school nearest them

been restored to 35% of pre-katrina levels as recently as the end of 2013 during the same period streetcars arrived at an average of once every seventeen minutes compared to bus frequencies of once every thirty-eight minutes the same priority was demonstrated in rtas spending increasing the proportion of its budget devoted to streetcars to more than three times compared to its pre-katrina budget through the end of 2017 counting both streetcar and bus trips only 51% of service had been restored to pre-katrina levels in 2017 the new orleans regional transit authority began operation on the extension of the rampart–st claude streetcar line another change to transit service that year was the re-routing of the 15 freret and 28 martin luther king bus routes to canal street these increased
