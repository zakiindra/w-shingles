local economy for decades 15 16 cotton cattle citrus climate and copper were known locally as the five cs anchoring phoenixs economy these remained the driving forces of the city until after world war

lands c 1350 the hohokam people occupied the phoenix area for 2000 years 24 25 they created roughly 135 miles 217 kilometers of irrigation canals making the desert land arable and paths of these canals were used for the arizona canal central arizona project canal and the hayden-rhodes aqueduct they also carried out extensive trade with the nearby ancient puebloans mogollon and sinagua as well as with the more distant mesoamerican civilizations 26 it is believed periods of drought and severe floods between 1300 and 1450 led to the hohokam civilizations abandonment of the area 27 after the departure of the hohokam groups of akimel oodham commonly known as pima tohono oodham and maricopa tribes began to use the area as well as segments of the yavapai and apache 28 the oodham were offshoots of the sobaipuri tribe who in turn were thought to be the descendants of the hohokam 29 30 31 the akimel oodham were the major group in the area they lived in small villages with well-defined irrigation systems that spread over the gila river valley from florence in the east to the estrellas in the west their crops included corn beans and squash for food as well as cotton and tobacco they banded with the maricopa for protection against incursions by the yuma and apache tribes 32 the maricopa are part of the larger yuma people however they migrated east from the lower colorado and gila rivers in the early 1800s when they began to be enemies with other yuma tribes settling among the existing communities of the akimel oodham 33 34 28 the tohono oodham also lived in the region but largely to the south and all the way to the mexican border 35 the oodham lived in small settlements as seasonal farmers who took advantage of the rains rather than the large-scale irrigation of the akimel they grew crops such as sweet corn tapery beans squash lentils sugar cane and melons as well as taking advantage of native plants such as saguaro fruits cholla buds mesquite tree beans and mesquite candy sap from the mesquite tree they also hunted local game such as deer rabbit and javelina for meat 36 37 the mexican–american war ended in 1848 mexico ceded its northern zone to the united states and the regions residents became us citizens the phoenix area became part of the new mexico territory 38 in 1863 the mining town of wickenburg was the first to be established in maricopa county to the northwest of phoenix maricopa county had not been incorporated the land was within yavapai county which included the major town of prescott to the north of wickenburg the army created fort mcdowell on the verde river in 1865 to forestall indian uprisings 39 the fort established a camp on the south side of the salt river by 1866 which was the first settlement in the valley after the decline of the hohokam other nearby settlements later merged to become the city of tempe 40 founding and incorporation edit the phillip darrell duppa adobe house was built in 1870 and is the oldest house in phoenix the homestead is named after lord darrell duppa an englishman who is credited with naming phoenix and tempe as well as founding the town of new river the history of phoenix begins with jack swilling a confederate veteran of the civil war who prospected in the nearby mining town of wickenburg in the newly formed arizona territory as he traveled through the salt river valley in 1867 he saw a potential for farming to supply wickenburg with food he also noted the eroded mounds of dirt that indicated previous canals dug by native peoples who had long since left the area he formed the swilling irrigation and canal company that year dug a large canal that drew in river water and erected several crop fields in a location that is now within the eastern portion of central phoenix near its airport other settlers soon began to arrive appreciating the areas fertile soil and lack of frost and the farmhouse swilling constructed became a frequently-visited location in the valley 41 42 lord darrell duppa was one of the original settlers in swillings party and he suggested the name phoenix as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization 24 the board of supervisors in yavapai county officially recognized the new town on may 4 1868 and the first post office was established the following month with swilling as the postmaster 24 in october 1870 valley residents met to select a new townsite for the valleys growing population a new location three miles to the west of the original settlement containing several allotments of farmland was chosen and lots began to officially be sold under the name of phoenix in december of that year this established the downtown core in a grid layout pattern that has been the hallmark of phoenixs urban development ever since on february 12 1871 the territorial legislature created maricopa county by dividing yavapai county it was the sixth one formed in the arizona territory the first election for county office was held in 1871 when tom barnum was elected the first sheriff he ran unopposed when the other two candidates john a chenowth and jim favorite fought a duel chenowth killed favorite and was forced to withdraw from the race 24 the town grew during the 1870s and president ulysses s grant issued a land patent for the site of phoenix on april 10 1874 by

incorporating phoenix as a city with a population of around 2500 24 the railroads arrival in the valley in the 1880s was the first of several events that made phoenix a trade center whose products reached eastern and western markets in response the phoenix chamber of commerce was organized on november 4 1888 44 the city offices moved into the new city hall at washington and central in 1888 24 the territorial capital moved from prescott to phoenix in 1889 and the territorial offices were also in city hall 45 the arrival of the santa fe prescott and phoenix railway in 1895 connected phoenix

howard taft 51 this occurred just six months after taft had vetoed a joint congressional resolution granting statehood to arizona due to his disapproval of the state constitutions position on the recall of judges 52 in 1913 phoenixs move from a mayor-council system to council-manager made it one of the first cities in the united states with this form of city government after statehood phoenixs

1920s and by 1930 stood at 48118 24 it was also during the 1930s that phoenix and its surrounding area began to be called the valley of the sun which was an advertising slogan invented to boost tourism 55 during world war ii phoenixs economy shifted to that of a distribution center transforming into an embryonic industrial city with the mass production of military supplies 24 there were three air force fields in the area luke field williams field and falcon field as well as two large pilot training camps thunderbird field no 1 in glendale and thunderbird field no 2 in scottsdale 24

operations 58 59 by 1950 over 105000 people resided in the city and thousands more in surrounding communities 24 the 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning which allowed homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat experienced in phoenix and the surrounding areas during its long summers there was more new construction in phoenix in 1959 alone than from 1914 to 1946 60 like many emerging american cities at the time phoenixs spectacular growth did not occur evenly it largely took place on the citys north side a region that was nearly all caucasian in 1962 one local

by 711% from 186000 in 1940 to 1509000 by 1980 due in part to air conditioning cheap housing and an influx of retirees the once modest urban sprawl now grew by epic proportions—not only a myriad of residential tract developments on both farmland and desert retail outlets and office complexes spread out and did not concentrate in the small downtown area there was low population density and a lack of widespread and significant high-rise development 90 as a consequence phoenix became a textbook case of urban sprawl for geographers 91 92 93 94 95 96 even though it is the fifth most populated city
