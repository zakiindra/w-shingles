river watershed western long island and the lower hudson valley most lenape were pushed out of the region during the 18th century as the original thirteen colonies expanded which was further

war against maryland colonists in 1648 the dutch built fort beversreede on the west bank of the delaware south of the schuylkill river near the present-day eastwick section of philadelphia to reassert their dominion over the area the swedes responded by building fort nya korsholm or new korsholm named after a town in finland with a swedish majority in 1655 a dutch military campaign led by new netherland director-general peter stuyvesant took control of the swedish colony ending its claim to independence the swedish and finnish settlers continued to have their own militia religion and court

william penn s charter for pennsylvania in 1681 in partial repayment of a debt charles ii of england granted penn a charter for what would become the pennsylvania colony despite the royal charter penn bought the land from the local lenape in an effort to establish good terms with the native americans and ensure peace for the colony penn made a treaty of friendship with lenape chief tammany under an elm tree at shackamaxon in what is now the citys fishtown neighborhood penn named the city philadelphia which is greek for brotherly love derived from the ancient greek terms φίλος phílos beloved dear and ἀδελφός adelphós brother brotherly there were a number of cities named philadelphia φιλαδέλφεια in the eastern mediterranean during the greek and roman periods including modern alaşehir mentioned as the site of an early christian congregation in the book of revelation as a quaker penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely this tolerance which exceeded that of other colonies led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered philadelphias rapid growth into americas most important city penn planned a city on the delaware river to serve as a port and place for government hoping that philadelphia would become more like an english rural town instead of a city penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart with areas for gardens and orchards the citys inhabitants did not follow penns plans however and instead crowded the present-day port of philadelphia on the delaware river and subdivided and resold their lots before penn left philadelphia for the final time he issued the charter of 1701 establishing it as a city though poor at first philadelphia became an

world seeking independence and liberty it also has been since its adoption the basis for annual celebration by americans in 1938 this celebration of the declaration was formalized as independence day one of only eleven designated us federal holidays after george washington s defeat at the battle of brandywine in chadds ford township on september 11 1777 during the philadelphia campaign the revolutionary capital of philadelphia was defenseless and the city prepared for what was perceived to be an inevitable british attack because bells could easily be recast into munitions the liberty bell then known as the pennsylvania state bell and bells from two philadelphia churches christ church and st peters church were hastily taken down and transported by heavily guarded wagon train out of the city the liberty bell was taken to zion german reformed church in northampton town which is present-day allentown where it was hidden under the churchs floor boards for nine months from september 1777 until departure of british forces from philadelphia in june 1778 two revolutionary war battles the siege of fort mifflin fought between september 26 and november 16 1777 and the battle of

philadelphia or about ten percent of the citys population at the time the capital of the united states was moved to washington dc in 1800 upon completion of the white house and us capitol buildings the state capital was moved from philadelphia to lancaster in 1799 then ultimately to harrisburg in 1812 philadelphia remained the nations largest city until the late 18th century it also was the

industry was celebrated in the centennial exposition the first official worlds fair in the us immigrants mostly from ireland and germany settled in philadelphia and the surrounding districts these immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in north america in 1835 in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday the city was a destination for thousands of irish immigrants fleeing the great famine in the 1840s housing for them was developed south of south street and later occupied by succeeding immigrants they established a network of catholic churches and schools and dominated the catholic clergy for decades anti-irish anti-catholic nativist riots erupted in philadelphia in 1844 the rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the act of consolidation of 1854 which extended the city limits from the 2 square miles 5.2 km of center city to the roughly 134 square miles 350 km of philadelphia county in the latter half of the 19th century and leading into the 20th century immigrants from russia eastern europe and italy and african americans from the southern us settled in the city philadelphia was represented by the washington grays in the american civil war the african-american population of philadelphia increased from 31699 to 219559 between 1880 and 1930 largely stemming from the great migration from the south 20th century by the 20th century philadelphia had an entrenched republican political machine and a complacent population in 1910 a general strike shut down the entire city in 1917 following outrage over the election-year murder of a philadelphia police officer the city council shrank from two houses to just one in july 1919 philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot during red summer in post- world war i unrest as recent immigrants competed with blacks for jobs in the 1920s the public flouting of prohibition laws organized crime mob violence and corrupt police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of brig gen smedley butler of the us marine corps as the citys director of public safety but political pressure still prevented long-term success in fighting crime and corruption in 1940 non-hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the citys population in 1950 the population peaked at more than two million residents then began to decline with the restructuring of industry that led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs in addition suburbanization enticed many affluent residents to depart the city for its outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing the resulting reduction in philadelphias tax base and the resources of local government caused the city to struggle through a long period of adjustment and it approached bankruptcy by the late 1980s in 1985 the move bombing of the cobbs creek neighborhood by city helicopters occurred killing 11 and destroying 61 homes revitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century with much of the development occurring in the center city and university city neighborhoods but this expanded a shortage of affordable housing in the city after many manufacturers and businesses left philadelphia or shut down the city started attracting service businesses and began to market itself more aggressively as a tourist destination contemporary glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in center city beginning in the 1980s historic areas such as old city and society hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s making both areas among the most desirable center city neighborhoods immigrants from around the world began to enter the us through philadelphia as their gateway leading to a reversal of the citys population decline between 1950 and 2000 during which it lost about 25 percent of its residents 21st century philadelphia eventually began experiencing a growth in its population in 2007 which continued with incremental annual increases through the present a migration pattern has been established from new york city to philadelphia by residents opting
