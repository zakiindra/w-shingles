indigenous territory at the confluence of the etowah and the oostanaula rivers which together form the coosa river because of its strategic advantages this area was long occupied by the historic creek later the cherokee people expanded into this area from their traditional homelands to the east and northeast national leaders such as major ridge and john ross resided here before indian removal in 1838 the city has developed on seven hills with the rivers running between them a feature that inspired the early european-american settlers to name it for rome the longtime capital of italy that was also built on seven hills the american rome developed in the antebellum period as a market and trading city due to its advantageous location on the rivers it shipped the rich regional cotton commodity crop downriver to markets on the gulf coast and export overseas in the late 1920s a united states company built a rayon plant in a joint project with an italian company this project and the american

northern creek territory called themselves the muscogee they merged with other creek tribes to become the ulibahali who later migrated westward into alabama in the general region of gadsden by the mid-18th century the iroquoian-speaking cherokee had moved into this area and occupied it they had moved down from areas of tennessee under pressure from settlement by americans migrating across the appalachians from eastern territories a cherokee village named etowah cherokee ꭱꮩꮹ romanized etowa which means head of coosa was settled in this area during the late 18th century in the period of the cherokee–american wars 1776–94 during and after the american revolutionary war several cherokee national leaders settled here and developed their own cotton plantations including chiefs major ridge and john ross some of the cherokee planters and others among the southeast tribes bought enslaved african americans to use as laborers on such plantations in the 20th century ridges home here was preserved as chieftains house it has been adapted by the state for use as the chieftains museum it is used to interpret the history of the cherokee in this area especially major ridge in the 18th century a high demand in europe for american deerskins had led to a brisk trade between indian hunters and white traders a few white traders and some settlers primarily from the british colonies of georgia and carolina were accepted by the head of coosa cherokee these were later joined by missionaries and more settlers after the american war of independence most new settlers came from the area of georgia east of the proclamation line of 1763 in 1793 in response to a cherokee raid into tennessee john sevier the governor of tennessee led a retaliatory raid against the cherokee in the vicinity of myrtle hill in what was known as the battle of hightower in 1802 the united states and georgia executed the compact of 1802 in which georgia sold its claimed western lands a claim dating to its colonial charter to the united states in return the federal government agreed to ignore cherokee land titles and remove all cherokee from georgia the commitment to evict the cherokee was not immediately enforced and chiefs john ross and major ridge led efforts to stop their removal including several federal lawsuits during the 1813 creek civil war most cherokee took the side of the lower creek indians who were more assimilated and willing to deal with european americans against the red sticks or upper creek as they had lived more isolated from the whites they had maintained strong conservative cultural traditions before the cherokee moved to head of coosa chief ridge commanded a company of warriors as a unit of the tennessee militia with chief ross as adjutant this cherokee unit was under the overall command of united states major andrew jackson and supported the upper creek they were the part of the creek who had adopted more european-american customs and were more aligned with american settlers the creek war played out within the us-british conflict of the war of 1812 in 1829 european americans discovered gold near dahlonega georgia starting the first gold rush in the united states congressional passage of the indian removal act of 1830 which fulfilled the compact of 1802 was related to that gold discovery and the desire of whites to settle the land as well as president andrew jacksons commitment to removal of native americans to enable development by the whites even before removal began in 1831 georgias general assembly passed legislation that claimed all cherokee land in northwest georgia this entire territory was called cherokee county the following year the assembly organized the territory as the nine counties that still exist in the 21st century city founding period rome was founded in 1834 as european americans increasingly settled in georgia founders were col daniel r mitchell col zacharia hargrove maj philip hemphill col william smith and john lumpkin nephew of governor lumpkin most were veterans of the war of 1812 they held a drawing at alhambra to determine the name of the new city with col mitchell submitting the name of rome because of the areas hills and rivers mitchells submission was drawn and the georgia legislature chartered rome as an official city in 1835 the county seat was subsequently moved east from the village of livingston to rome with the entire area still occupied primarily by cherokee the city developed to serve the agrarian needs of the new cotton-based economy invention of the cotton gin in the late 18th century made processing of short-staple cotton profitable this was the type of cotton that best thrived in the upland areas in contrast to that grown on the sea islands and in the low country much of upland georgia was developed as what became known as the black belt named for the fertile soil planters brought or purchased many enslaved african americans as workers for the labor-intensive crop the leading cherokee participated in the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop which soon replaced deerskin trading as a source of wealth in the region the first steamboat navigated the coosa river to rome in 1836 reducing the time-to-market for the cotton trade and speeding travel between rome and new orleans on the gulf coast the major port for export of cotton by 1838 the cherokee had run out of legal options in resisting removal they were the last of the major southeast tribes to be forcibly moved to the indian territory in modern-day oklahoma on the trail of tears after the removal of the cherokee their homes and businesses were taken over by whites with much of the property distributed through a land lottery the rome economy continued to grow in 1849 an 18-mile 29 km rail spur to the western and atlantic railroad in kingston was completed significantly improving transportation to the east this route was later followed in the 20th-century construction of georgia highway 293 by 1860 the population had reached 4010 in the city and 15195 in the county civil war period romes iron works were an important manufacturing center during the civil war supplying many cannons and other armaments to the confederate effort in april 1863 the city was defended by confederate general nathan bedford forrest against union colonel abel streights lightning mule raid from the area east of modern-day cedar bluff alabama general forrest tricked colonel streight into surrendering just a few miles shy of rome realizing their vulnerability romes city council had allocated $3000 to build three fortifications although these became operational by october 1863 efforts to strengthen the forts continued as the war progressed these forts were named after romans who had been killed in action fort attaway was on the western bank of the oostanaula river fort norton was on the eastern bank of the oostanaula and fort stovall was on the southern bank of the etowah river the confederates later built at least one other fort on the northern side of the coosa river in may 1864 union general jefferson c davis under the command of major general william tecumseh sherman attacked and captured rome when the outflanked confederate defenders retreated under command of major general samuel gibbs french union general william vandever was stationed in rome and is

a clock tower visible from many points in the city it has served as the towns iconic landmark ever since and is featured in the citys crest and local business logos as a result neely hill is also referred to as tower or clock tower hill during reconstruction the state legislature authorized public schools in 1868 for the first time and designated some funding to support them the city established its first public schools schools were racially segregated and tended to have short sessions because of limited funding in addition many families depended on their children to work in agriculture and other basic survival work freedmen had been granted the franchise and tended to join the republican party of president abraham lincoln who had freed them the abolition of slavery required new labor arrangements to arrange for paid labor due to its riverside location rome has occasionally suffered serious flooding the flood of 1886 inundated the city to such depth that a steamboat traveled down broad street in 1891 upon recommendation of the united states army corps of engineers the georgia state legislature amended romes charter to create a commission to oversee the construction of river levees to protect the town against future floods in the late 1890s additional flood control measures were instituted including raising the height of broad street by about 15 feet 4.6 m as a result the original entrances and ground-level floors of many of romes historic buildings became covered over and had to serve as basements twentieth century in the early 20th century the

sculpture of romulus and remus nursing from the capitoline wolf the statue was placed in front of city hall on a base of white marble from tate georgia with a brass plaque inscribed this statue of the capitoline wolf as a forecast of prosperity and glory has been sent from ancient rome to new rome during the consulship of benito mussolini in the year 1929 in 1940 anti-italian sentiment due to world war ii became so strong that the rome city commission moved the statue into storage to prevent vandalism they replaced it with an american flag in 1952 the city restored the statue to its former location in front of city hall great depression in rome the effect of the great depression was significantly less severe than in other larger cities across the united states since rome was an agricultural town food could be grown in surrounding areas romes textile mill continued operating providing steady jobs for whites as a buffer against the economic hardships of the great depression the great depression was preceded by the cotton bust across the south this reached rome in the mid-1920s and caused many farmers to move away sell their land or convert to other agricultural crops such as corn farm workers were displaced and many african americans left the area in the great migration seeking work in cities including those in the north and midwest cotton crops were being destroyed by the boll weevil a tiny insect that reached georgia in 1915 invading from louisiana the boll weevil destroyed many fields of cotton and suppressed romes economy many families struggled through hard financial times jobs were scarce and prices of food and basic commodities went up the federal postal employees took a fifteen per cent cut in pay and volunteered a further ten per cent

vra was passed the city amended its charter with approval by the state legislature reducing the number of wards from nine to three with commission members to be elected by at-large voting to numbered

after the first round of voting from 1964 to 1975 the legislature approved the citys 60 acts for annexations which appropriated mostly areas with white-majority populations at the same time the board of education was increased to six members elected from three wards with two numbered positions to be elected at-large from the city for each ward a majority vote was required to win with runoff procedures to apply to the top two candidates if no majority was achieved a residency requirement was added for the board members this entire proposal was subject to review under the vra the city
