seeking to take advantage of nevadas relatively lax divorce laws and the city gained a national reputation as a divorce mill today reno is a tourist destination known for its casino gambling and proximity to lake tahoe and the sierra nevada mountains history edit for a chronological guide see timeline of reno nevada aerial view of reno in 1925 early history edit archaeological finds place the eastern border for the prehistoric martis people in the reno area 7 as early as the mid-1850s a few pioneers settled in the truckee meadows a relatively fertile valley through which the truckee river made its way from lake tahoe to pyramid lake in addition to subsistence farming these early residents could pick up business from travelers along the california trail which followed the truckee westward before branching off towards donner lake where the formidable obstacle of the sierra nevada began gold was discovered in the vicinity of virginia city in 1850 and a modest mining community developed but the discovery of silver in 1859 at the comstock lode led to a mining rush and thousands of emigrants left their homes bound for the west hoping to find a fortune to provide the necessary connection between virginia city and the california trail charles w fuller built a log toll bridge across the truckee river in 1859 a small community that served travelers soon grew near the bridge 8 after two years fuller sold the bridge to myron c lake who continued to develop the community by adding a grist mill kiln and livery stable to the hotel and eating house he renamed it lakes crossing most of what is present-day western nevada was formed as the nevada territory from part of utah territory in 1861 by january 1863 the central pacific railroad cprr had begun laying tracks east from sacramento california eventually connecting with the union pacific railroad at promontory utah to form the first transcontinental railroad lake deeded land to the cprr in exchange for its promise to build a depot at lakes crossing in 1864 washoe county was consolidated with roop county and lakes crossing became the countys largest town lake had earned himself the title founder of reno 9 once the railroad station was established the town of reno officially came into being on may 9 1868 10 cprr construction superintendent charles crocker named the community after major general jesse lee reno a union officer killed in the civil war at the battle of south mountain in 1871 reno became the county seat of the newly expanded washoe county replacing the county seat in washoe city however political power in nevada remained with the mining communities first virginia city and later tonopah and goldfield 11 12 the extension of the virginia and truckee railroad to reno in 1872 provided a boost to the new citys economy in the following decades reno continued to grow and prosper as a business and agricultural center and became the principal settlement on the transcontinental railroad between sacramento and salt lake city 13 as the mining boom waned early in the 20th century nevadas centers of political and business activity shifted to the nonmining communities especially reno and las vegas nevada is still the third-largest gold producer in the world after south africa and australia the state yielded 6.9% of the worlds supply in 2005 world gold production 14 the reno arch was erected on virginia street in 1926 to promote the upcoming transcontinental highways exposition of 1927 the arch included the words nevadas transcontinental highways exposition and the dates of the exposition after the exposition the reno city council decided to keep the arch as a permanent downtown gateway and mayor ee roberts asked the citizens of reno to suggest a slogan for the arch no acceptable slogan was received until a $100 prize was offered and ga burns of sacramento was declared the winner on march 14 1929 with reno the biggest little city in the world 15 the divorce capital of the world edit in the early twentieth century nevada became a popular destination for migratory divorce in an era when most states had highly restrictive laws on the subject legislation passed in 1931 completed the gradual reduction of residency requirement from six months to six weeks and reno openly advertised itself as the divorce capital of the world nevadas laws which were fairly progressive for the time allowed numerous grounds for divorce and renos courts quickly gained a reputation for handling cases with both celerity and sympathy for those seeking to untie the knot from the 1930s through the 1960s reno became synonymous with speedy divorce often referred to colloquially as the six week cure during these decades the citys reputation drew thousands of divorcees annually and they in turn became an important part of the local economy these temporary residents flocked to hotels boardinghouses and hospitality ranches many of which catered primarily to those waiting out the six week residency requirement before their court date 16 numerous local businesses openly courted these visitors such as r herz & bro a jewelry store that offered ring resetting services to the recently divorced and the luxurious el cortez hotel which was built in part to accommodate the more affluent among renos six week guests 17 18 the majority of those who came to reno for divorce were women as nevada did not require both parties in a divorce case to be present in court and men often could not take that much time off from work although new residents seeking divorce were required to swear under oath that they intended to make nevada their permanent home most left soon after obtaining their divorce decree which often occurred on the same day as the initial court hearing 16 in addition to tens of thousands of ordinary people reno also became a major destination for celebrities and the very wealthy looking to end their marriages as quickly as possible some of the many famous personages who got divorced in reno include mary pickford jack dempsey general douglas macarthur carol lombard tallulah bankhead adlai stevenson ii lana turner nelson rockefeller georges simenon rita hayworth gloria vanderbilt and cornelius vanderbilt iv the latter was married seven times and had five of his six divorces in nevada mr vanderbilt was so taken with reno that unlike most migrant divorcees he eventually settled there permanently 19 20 in the 1939 film the women reno and its divorce culture serve as a backdrop to a significant part of the plot ernie pyle once wrote in one of his columns all the people you saw on the streets in reno were obviously there to get divorces in ayn rand s novel the fountainhead published in 1943 the new york-based female protagonist tells a friend i am going to reno which was understood as declaring their intention to get a divorce 21 the divorce business eventually died out during the 1970s as other states began relaxing their laws and especially with the widespread introduction of no fault divorce 16 gambling and modern reno edit reno took a leap forward when the state of nevada legalized open gambling on march 19 1931 at the same time as it liberalized its divorce laws the statewide push for legal nevada gaming was led by reno entrepreneur bill graham who owned the bank club casino in reno which was on center street no other state offered legalized casino gaming like nevada had in the 1930s and casinos such as the bank club and palace were popular citation needed a few states had legal parimutuel horse racing but no other state had legal casino gambling within a few years the bank club owned by george wingfield bill graham and jim mckay was the states largest employer and the largest casino in the world wingfield owned most of the buildings in town that housed gaming and took a percentage of the profits along with his rent 22 as the divorce industry declined gambling became the major reno industry while gaming pioneers such as pappy and harold smith of harolds club and bill harrah of the soon-to-dominate harrahs casino set up shop in the 1930s the war years of the 1940s cemented reno as the place to play for two decades 23 beginning in the 1950s the need for economic diversification beyond gaming fueled a movement for more lenient business taxation 21 at 103 pm on february 5 1957 two explosions caused by natural gas leaking into the maze of pipes and ditches under the city and an ensuing fire destroyed five buildings in the vicinity of sierra and first streets along the truckee river the disaster killed two people and injured 49 the first explosion hit under the block of shops on the west side of sierra street now the site of the century riverside the second across sierra street now the site of the palladio citation needed the presence of a main east–west rail line the emerging interstate highway system favorable state tax climate and relatively inexpensive land created good conditions for warehousing and distribution of goods citation needed in the 1980s indian gaming rules were relaxed and starting in 2000 californian native casinos began to cut into reno casino revenues 24 major new construction projects have been completed in the reno and sparks areas a few new luxury communities were built in truckee california about 28 miles 45 km west of reno on interstate 80 reno also is an outdoor recreation destination due to its proximity to the sierra nevada lake tahoe and numerous ski resorts in the region 25 in 2018 the city officially changed its flag after a local contest was held 26 in recent years the reno metro area − spurred by large-scale investments from greater seattle and san francisco bay area companies such as amazon tesla panasonic microsoft apple and google − has become a new major technology center in the united states 27 geography edit environmental considerations edit wetlands are an important part of the reno tahoe area they act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it wetlands are home to over 75% of the species in the great basin however the areas wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city while developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with soil destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals washoe county has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems mitigation in the future when developers try to build over a wetland they will be responsible for creating another wetland near washoe lake the truckee river is renos primary source of drinking water it supplies reno with 80 million us gallons 300 ml of water a day during the summer and 40 million us gallons 150 ml of water per day in the winter before the water goes to the homes around the reno area it must go to one of two water treatment plants chalk bluff or glendale water treatment plant to help save water golf courses in reno have been using treated effluent water rather than treated water from one of renos water plants the reno-sparks wastewater treatment plant discharges tertiary-treated effluent to the truckee river in the 1990s this capacity was increased from 20 to 30 million us gallons 70 to 110 million liters per day while treated the effluent contains suspended solids nitrogen and phosphorus aggravating water-quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of pyramid lake local agencies working with the environmental protection agency have developed several watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded discharge to accomplish this successful outcome the dssam model was developed and calibrated for the truckee river to analyze the most cost-effective available management strategy set 28 the resulting management strategies included measures such as land use controls in the lake tahoe basin urban runoff controls in reno and sparks and best management practices for wastewater discharge reno nevada and the truckee meadows south west of the reno tahoe international airport has a large herd of mustang horses these horses nurse and range around the runoff of steamboat creek the mustang is a notable iconic image of the nevada range land which includes reno the reno area is often subject to wildfires that cause property damage and sometimes loss of life in august 1960 the donner ridge fire resulted in a loss of electricity to the city for four days 29 in november 2011 arcing from powerlines caused a fire in caughlin in southwest reno that destroyed 26 homes and killed one man just two months later a fire in washoe drive sparked by fireplace ashes destroyed 29 homes and killed one woman around 10000 residents were evacuated and a state of emergency was declared the fires came at the end of renos longest recorded dry spell 30 geology edit dog valley west of reno an area of active faulting reno is just east of the sierra nevada on the western edge of the great basin at an elevation of about 4400 feet 1300 m above sea level numerous faults exist throughout the region most of these are normal vertical motion faults associated with the uplift of the various mountain ranges including the sierra nevada in february 2008 an earthquake swarm began to occur lasting for several months with the largest quake registering at 4.9 on the richter magnitude scale although some geologic estimates put it at 5.0 the earthquakes were centered on the somersett community in western reno near mogul and verdi many homes in these areas were damaged 31 the unique high desert geological features cause many to describe nevada as a rockhounds paradise access to millions of acres of government land allows geologists miners and amateur rockhounds in nevada to hunt to your hearts content being able to find agate opal jasper fossils fluorescent minerals obsidian chalcedony wonderstone malachite petrified wood limb casts and much more means paradise 32 climate edit reno has a cold semi-arid climate köppen bsk bordering a hot-summer mediterranean climate köppen csa to the west it experiences moderately cold winters and hot summers it is influenced by the sierra nevada mountains to the west and the more arid great basin to the east 33 it is situated across a varied geographic landscape which extends from the foothills of the sierra nevada into the truckee river valley while reno experiences a rain shadow effect from the surrounding mountains its western portions can receive three to four times as much precipitation as those extending eastward 34 annual rainfall patterns in reno adhere to a mediterranean climate with most precipitation occurring in fall winter and spring followed by long hot dry summers 34 however renos average annual rainfall is slightly lower than that of californian cities more typically associated with mediterranean climates the areas low evapotranspiration stemming from its moderate annual average temperature also bears similarity to semi-arid climates found in nevadas great basin 35 the monthly daily average temperature ranges from 36.2 °f 2.3 °c in december to 77.2 °f 25.1 °c in july with the diurnal temperature variation occasionally reaching 40 °f 22 °c in summer still lower than much of the high desert to the east there are 6.0 days of 100 °f 38 °c + highs 65 days of 90 °f 32 °c + highs 1.6 days with 70 °f 21 °c + lows and 1.9 days with sub-10 °f −12 °c lows annually the temperature reaches or dips below the freezing point on 122 days and does not rise above freezing on only 4.1 of those days 36 the all-time record high temperature is 108 °f 42 °c which occurred on july 10 and 11 2002 again on july 5 2007 and again on july 16 2023 the all-time record low temperature is −17 °f −27 °c which occurred on january 21 1916 the lowest temperature recorded at the airport is −16 °f −27 °c which occurred on four occasions most recently on february 7 1989 36 in addition the region is windy throughout the year observers such as mark twain have commented about the washoe zephyr northwestern nevadas distinctive wind annual precipitation has ranged from 1.55 inches 39.4 mm in 1947 to 13.73 inches 348.7 mm in 2017 the most precipitation in one month was 6.76 inches 171.7 mm in january 1916 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was 2.71 inches 68.8 mm on january 28 1903 at reno–tahoe international airport where records go back to 1937 the most precipitation in one month was 5.57 inches 141.5 mm in january 2017 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was 2.29 inches 58.2 mm on january 21 1943 36 most rainfall occurs in winter and spring summer thunderstorms can occur between april and october the eastern side of town and the mountains east of reno tend to be prone to thunderstorms more often and these storms may be severe because an afternoon downslope west wind called a washoe zephyr can develop in the sierra nevada causing air to be pulled down in the sierra nevada and reno destroying or preventing thunderstorms but the same wind can push air upward against the virginia range and other mountain ranges east of reno creating powerful thunderstorms 37 38 winter snowfall is usually light to moderate but can be heavy some days averaging 20.9 inches 53 cm annually snowfall varies with the lowest amounts roughly 19–23 inches annually at the lowest part of the valley at and east of the airport at 4404 feet 1342 m while the foothills of the carson range to the west ranging from 4700 to 5600 feet 1400 to 1700 m in elevation just a few miles west of downtown can receive two to three times as much annual snowfall the mountains of the virginia range to the east meanwhile can receive more summer thunderstorms and precipitation and around twice as much annual snowfall above 5500 feet 1700 m however snowfall increases in the virginia range are less dramatic as elevation climbs than in the carson range to the west because the virginia range is well within the rain shadow of the sierra nevada and carson range the most snowfall in reno in one winter was 72.3 inches 184 cm in 1915–1916 with an astonishing 65.7 inches 167 cm in january the most in a calendar month as well as 22.5 inches 57 cm on january 17 the most in a calendar day the most snowfall in a calendar year was 82.3 inches 209 cm in 1916 36
