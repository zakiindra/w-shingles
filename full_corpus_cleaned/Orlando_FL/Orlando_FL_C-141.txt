united states orlando is home to the university of central florida one of the largest universities in the united states the citys major league professional sports teams include orlando city sc mls and the orlando magic nba etymology fort gatlin as the orlando area was once known was established at what is now just south of the city limits by the 4th us artillery under the command of lieutenant colonel alexander c w fanning on november 9 1838 during the construction of a series of fortified encampments across florida during the second seminole war the fort and surrounding area were named for john s gatlin an army physician who was killed in dades massacre on december 28 1835 the site of construction for fort gatlin a defensible position with fresh water between three small lakes was likely chosen because the location was on a main trail and is less than 250 yards from a nearby council oak tree where native americans had traditionally met king phillip and coacoochee frequented this area and the tree was alleged to be the place where the previous 1835 ambush that had killed over 100 soldiers had been planned when the us military abandoned the fort in 1839 the surrounding community was built up by settlers prior to being known by its current name orlando was once known as jernigan this name originates from the first european permanent settlers isaac and aaron jernigan cattlemen who moved from the state of georgia and acquired land 2 miles 3.2 km northwest of fort gatlin along the west end of lake holden in july 1843 by the terms of the armed occupation act aaron jernigan became orange countys first state representative in 1845 but his pleas for additional military protection went unanswered fort gatlin was briefly reoccupied by the military for a few weeks during october and november 1849 and subsequently a volunteer militia was left to defend the settlement a historical marker indicates that by 1850 the jernigan homestead or fort gatlin in some sources served as the nucleus of a village named jernigan according to an account written years later by his daughter at that time about 80 settlers were forced to shelter for about a year in a stockade that aaron jernigan built on the north side of lake conway one of the countys first records a grand jurys report mentions a stockade where it states homesteaders were driven from their homes and forced to huddle together in hasty defences sic in 1852 aaron jernigan led a local volunteer militia beginning in advance of the third seminole war a post office opened at jernigan in 1850 jernigan appears on an 1855 map of florida and by 1856 the area had become the county seat of orange county in 1857 the post office was removed from jernigan and opened under the name of orlando at a new location in present-day downtown orlando the move is believed to have been sparked in part by aaron jernigans fall from grace after he was relieved of his militia command by military officials in 1856 his behavior was so notorious that united states secretary of war jefferson davis wrote it is said they jernigans militia are more dreadful than the indians in 1859 jernigan and his sons were accused of committing a murder at the towns post office they were then transported to ocala but escaped during the american civil war the post office closed but reopened in 1866 at a meeting in 1857 debate had grown concerning the name of the town pioneer william b hull recalled how james speer a local resident and prominent figure in the stories behind the naming of orlando rose in the heat of the argument and said this place is often spoken of as orlandos grave lets drop the word grave and let the county seat be orlando the origin of the name is unknown but at least five stories relate how orlando got its name the most common stories are that the name orlando originated from the tale of a man who died in 1835 during an attack by native americans in the area during the second seminole war several of the stories relay an oral history of the marker for a person named orlando and the double entendre here lies orlando one variant includes a man named orlando who was passing by on his way to tampa with a herd of oxen died and was buried in a marked grave through a retelling of history a marker of some sort was believed to have been found by one of the original pioneers but speers family has since claimed that speer simply used the orlando reeves legend to help push his plan for naming the settlement after the shakespearean character from as you like it his favorite play this has become the most common accepted version of how orlando got its name orlando reeves historians agree that likely no soldier was named orlando reeves folklore is that reeves was acting as a sentinel for a company of soldiers that had set up camp for the night on the banks of sandy beach lake several different lakes are mentioned in the various versions as no soldiers were in what is now downtown during 1835 the legend grew throughout the early 1900s particularly with local historian olive brumbaugh or kena fries retelling in various writings and on local radio station wdbo in 1929 another historian eldon h gore promoted the reeves legend in history of orlando published in 1949 a memorial beside lake eola – originally placed by students of orlandos cherokee junior school in 1939 and updated in 1990 – designates the spot where the citys supposed namesake fell conflicting legends exist one legend has reeves killed during an extended battle with the seminoles after being field promoted after his platoon commander fell an in-depth review of military records in the 1970s and 1980s though turned up no record of orlando reeves ever existing some versions attempt to account for reeves having no military records by using the name of other people named orlando that exist in some written records – orlando acosta however not much is known about acosta or whether he even existed another version of the story has orlando reed supposedly an englishman and mail carrier between fort gatlin and fort mellon allegedly killed while camping with his friends near fort gatlin a second variation also places the story in 1835 during the second seminole war this name is taken from a south carolinian cattle rancher named orlando savage rees rees owned a volusia county sugar mill and plantation as well as several large estates in florida and mississippi rees sugar farms in the area were burned out in the seminole attacks of 1835 the year orlando reeves supposedly died subsequently rees led an expedition to recover stolen slaves and cattle in 1837 rees also attempted to stop a peace treaty with the seminoles because it did not reimburse him for the loss of slaves and crops rees could have left a pine-bough marker with his name next to the trail later residents misread rees as reeves and also mistook it as a grave maker in subsequent years this story has merged with the orlando reeves story which may have originally incorporated part of dr gatlins story on two separate occasions relatives of rees claimed their ancestor was the namesake of the city f k bull of south carolina rees great-grandson told an orlando reporter of a story in 1955 years later charles m bull jr of orlando rees great-great-grandson offered local historians similar information unlike orlando reeves who cannot be traced to any historical record the record is considerable that orlando rees did exist and was in florida during that time for example in 1832 john james audubon met with rees in his large estate at spring garden about 45 minutes from orlando orlando as you like it the final variation has the city named after the protagonist in the shakespeare play as you like it in 1975 judge donald a cheney put forth a new version of the story in an orlando sentinel article cheney a local historian and then chairman of the county historical commission recounted a story told to him by his father judge john moses cheney a major figure in orlandos history who arrived in orlando in 1885 the elder cheney recounted that another gentleman at that time james speer proposed the name orlando after the character in as you like it according to cheney speer was a gentleman of culture and an admirer of william shakespeare quoting a letter that speer wrote orlando was a veritable forest of arden the locale of as you like it speers descendants have also confirmed this version of the naming and the legend has continued to grow this account also has some validity in that as mentioned above speer was instrumental in changing the name of the settlement from jernigan to orlando though he may have used the orlando reeves legend in lieu of his true intent to use the shakespearean character according to yet another version of the story orlando may have been the name of one of his employees one of downtown orlandos major streets is named rosalind avenue rosalind is the heroine of as you like it but this could also be a coincidence history settlement in 1823 the treaty of moultrie creek created a seminole reservation encompassing much of central florida including the area that would become orlando the indian removal act of 1830 authorized relocation of the seminole from florida to oklahoma and along with the enforcement of the treaty of paynes landing led to the second seminole war in 1842 white settlement in the area was encouraged by the armed occupation act the first settler aaron jernigan of camden county georgia arrived the following year and settled near lake holden mosquito county was renamed orange county in 1845 with the county seat shortly thereafter relocated to mellonville a few miles west of sanford by 1856 settlement had begun in earnest in the interior of the county and a more centrally located courthouse was sought the new town of orlando laid out in 1857 consisted of four streets surrounding a courthouse square the fledgling village suffered greatly during the union blockade the reconstruction era brought on a population explosion resulting in the incorporation of the town of orlando on july 31 1875 with 85 residents 22 voters for a short time in 1879 the town revoked its charter and was subsequently reincorporated orlando was established as a city in 1885 the period from 1875 to 1895 is remembered as orlandos golden era when it became the hub of floridas citrus industry the period ended with the great freeze of 1894–95 which forced many owners to give up their independent citrus groves thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few citrus barons who shifted operations south primarily around lake wales in polk county the freeze caused many in florida including many orlandoans to move elsewhere mostly to the north california or the caribbean notable homesteaders in the area included the curry family through their property in east orlando flowed the econlockhatchee river which travelers crossed by fording this was commemorated by the streets name curry ford road also just south of the orlando international airport in the boggy creek area are 150 acres 0.61 km2 of property homesteaded in the late 19th century by the ward family this property is still owned by the ward family and can be seen from southbound flights out of orlando international airport immediately on the south side of sr 417 post-industrial revolution orlando became a popular resort during the years between the spanish–american war and world war i in the 1920s orlando experienced extensive housing development during the florida land boom causing land prices to soar during this period dozens of neighborhoods in the vicinity of downtown were constructed the boom ended when several hurricanes hit florida in the late 1920s along with the great depression during world war ii a number of army personnel were stationed at the orlando army air base and nearby pinecastle army air field some of these servicemen stayed in orlando to settle and raise families in 1956 the aerospace and defense company martin marietta now lockheed martin established a plant in the city orlando aab and pinecastle aaf were transferred to the united states air force in 1947 when it became a separate service and were redesignated as air force bases afb in 1958 pinecastle afb was renamed mccoy air force base after colonel michael n w mccoy a former commander of the 320th bombardment wing at the installation killed in the crash of a b-47 stratojet bomber north of orlando in the 1960s the base subsequently became home to the 306th bombardment wing of the strategic air command operating b-52 stratofortress and kc-135 stratotanker aircraft in addition to detachment operations by ec-121 and u-2 aircraft in 1968 orlando afb was transferred to the united states navy and became naval training center orlando in addition to boot camp facilities the ntc orlando was home of one of two navy nuclear power schools and home of the naval air warfare center training systems division when mccoy afb closed in 1976 its runways and territory to its south and east were imparted to the city to become orlando international airport while a small portion to the northwest was transferred to the navy as mccoy ntc annex that closed in 1995 and became a housing though the former mccoy afb still hosts a navy exchange as well as national guard and reserve units for several branches of service ntc orlando was completely closed by the end of 1999 by the base realignment and closure commission and converted into the baldwin park neighborhood the naval air warfare center had moved to central florida research park near ucf in 1989 tourism in history a major factor in orlandos growth occurred in 1962 when the new orlando jetport the precursor of the present-day orlando international airport was built from a portion of the mccoy air force base by 1970 four major airlines delta air lines national airlines eastern airlines and southern airways were providing scheduled flights mccoy air force base officially closed in 1975 and most of it is now part of the airport the airport still retains the former air force base airport code mco perhaps the most critical event for orlandos economy though occurred in 1965 when walt disney announced plans to build walt disney world although disney had considered the regions of miami and tampa for his park one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to hurricanes – orlandos inland location although not free from hurricane damage exposed it to less threat than coastal regions the vacation resort opened in october 1971 ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the orlando metropolitan area which now encompasses orange seminole osceola and lake counties as a result tourism became the centerpiece of the areas economy orlando now has more theme parks and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world 21st century today the historic core of old orlando resides in downtown orlando along church street between orange avenue and garland avenue the urban development and the central business district of downtown have rapidly shaped the downtown skyline during recent history the present-day historic district is primarily associated with the neighborhoods around lake eola but stretches west across the city to lake lorna doone and north into the college park neighborhood where you can find century-old oaks line brick streets these neighborhoods include the downtown business district north quarter parramore callahan south eola heights lake

including the gunman were killed and 60 were wounded the gunman whom the police swat team shot to death was identified as 29-year-old omar mir seddique mateen an american security guard the act of

intention to acquire the pulse nightclub to build a permanent memorial for the 49 victims of the shooting the city offered to buy it for $2.25 million but the clubs owner declined to sell geography the geography of orlando is mostly wetlands consisting of many lakes and swamps the terrain is generally flat making the land fairly low and wet the area is dotted with hundreds of lakes the largest of which is lake apopka central floridas bedrock is mostly limestone and very porous the orlando area is susceptible to sinkholes probably the most famous incident involving a sinkhole happened in 1981 in winter park a city immediately north of downtown orlando dubbed the winter park sinkhole cityscape neighborhoods there are 115 neighborhoods within the city limits and many unincorporated communities orlandos city limits resemble a checkerboard with pockets of unincorporated orange county surrounded by city limits such an arrangement results in some areas being served by both orange county and the city of orlando this also explains orlandos relatively low city population when compared to its metropolitan population the city and county are working together in an effort to round-out the city limits with orlando annexing portions of land already bordering the city limits at the center of the greater orlando region is downtown orlando the historic core and central

subtropical climate köppen cfa trewartha cfhl the two basic seasons in orlando are a very hot and rainy season lasting from may until late october roughly coinciding with the atlantic hurricane season and a mild and dry season from november through april the areas warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation its position relatively close to the tropic of cancer and its location in the center of a peninsula many characteristics of its climate are a result of its proximity to the gulf stream which flows around the peninsula of florida during the height of orlandos humid summer season high temperatures are typically in the low 90s °f 32–34 °c while low temperatures rarely fall below the low 70s °f 22–24 °c the average window for 90 °f 32 °c temperatures is april 9 to october 14 the areas humidity acts as a buffer usually preventing actual temperatures from exceeding 100 °f 38 °c but also pushing the heat index to over 110 °f 43 °c the citys highest recorded temperature is 103 °f 39 °c set on september 8 1921 during these months strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily these storms are caused by air masses from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean colliding over central florida they are highlighted by spectacular lightning and can also bring heavy rain sometimes several inches per hour and powerful winds as well as rare damaging hail during the winter humidity is much lower and temperatures are more moderate and can fluctuate more readily the monthly daily average temperature in january is 60.6 °f 15.9 °c temperatures dip below the freezing mark on an average of only 1.6 nights per year and the lowest recorded temperature is 18 °f −8 °c set on december 28 1894 the annual mean minimum is just above 30 °f −1 °c putting orlando in hardiness zone 10a because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts and their accompanying precipitation have passed snow is exceptionally rare the only accumulation ever to occur in the city proper since record keeping began was in 1948 although some accumulation occurred in surrounding areas in a snow event in january 1977 that reached miami flurries have also been observed in 1989 2006 and 2010 the average annual rainfall in orlando is 51.45 inches 1307 mm a majority of which occurs in the period from june to september october through may are orlandos dry season during this period especially in its later months often a wildfire hazard exists during some years fires have been severe in 1998 a strong el niño caused an unusually wet january and february followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air-quality alerts in orlando and severely affected normal daily life including the postponement of that years pepsi 400 nascar race in nearby daytona beach orlando is a major population center and has a considerable hurricane risk although it is not as high as in south floridas urban corridor or other coastal regions since the city is located 42 miles 68 km inland from the atlantic and 77 miles 124 km inland from the gulf of mexico hurricanes usually weaken before arriving storm surges are not a concern since the region is 100 feet 30 m above mean sea level despite its location the city does see strong hurricanes during the notorious 2004 hurricane season orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage with hurricane charley the worst of these the city also experienced widespread damage during hurricane donna in 1960 in recent years hurricanes irma 2017 ian 2022 and milton 2024 brought some notable damages to the city tornadoes are not usually connected with the strong thunderstorms of the humid summer they are more common
