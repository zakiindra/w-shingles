berkeley is considered one of the most socially progressive cities in the united states ### history### indigenous history is typical of those used by the ohlone people to grind acorns the site of todays city of berkeley was the territory of the chochenyo huchiun ohlone people when the first europeans arrived evidence of their existence in the area include pits in rock formations which they used to grind acorns and a shellmound now mostly leveled and covered up along the shoreline of san francisco bay at the mouth of strawberry creek human remains and skeletons from native american burials have been unearthed in west berkeley and on campus alongside strawberry creek other artifacts were discovered in the 1950s in the downtown area during remodeling of a commercial building near the upper course of the creek ### spanish and mexican eras the first people of european descent most of whom were of mixed race and born in america arrived with the de anza expedition in 1776 the de anza expedition led to establishment of the spanish presidio of san francisco at the entrance to san francisco bay the golden gate luis peralta was among the soldiers at the presidio for his services to the king of spain he was granted a vast stretch of land on the east shore of san francisco bay the contra costa opposite shore for a ranch including that portion that now comprises the city of berkeley was part of rancho san antonio granted to the peralta family in 1820 luis peralta named his holding rancho san antonio the primary activity of the ranch was raising cattle for meat and hides but hunting and farming were also pursued eventually peralta gave portions of the ranch to each of his four sons what is now berkeley lies mostly in the portion that went to peraltas son domingo with a little in the portion that went to another son vicente no artifact survives of the domingo or vicente ranches but their names survive in berkeley street names vicente domingo and peralta however legal title to all land in the city of berkeley remains based on the original peralta land grant the peraltas rancho san antonio continued after alta california passed from spanish to mexican sovereignty after the mexican war of independence however the advent of us sovereignty after the mexican–american war and especially the gold rush saw the peraltas lands quickly encroached on by squatters and diminished by dubious legal proceedings the lands of the brothers domingo and vicente were quickly reduced to reservations close to their respective ranch homes the rest of the land was surveyed and parceled out to various american claimants see kellersbergers map politically the area that became berkeley was initially part of a vast contra costa county on march 25 1853 alameda county was created from a division of contra costa county as well as from a small portion of santa clara county the area that became berkeley was then the northern part of the oakland township subdivision of alameda county during this period berkeley was mostly a mix of open land farms and ranches with a small though busy wharf by the bay ### late 19th century in 1875 in 1866 oaklands private college of california looked for a new site it settled on a location north of oakland along the foot of the contra costa range later called the berkeley hills astride strawberry creek at an elevation of about above the bay commanding a view of the bay area and the pacific ocean through the golden gate according to the centennial record of the university of california in 1866 at founders rock a group of college of california men watched two ships standing out to sea through the golden gate one of them frederick billings thought of the lines of the anglo-irish anglican bishop george berkeley westward the course of empire takes its way and suggested that the town and college site be named for the eighteenth-century anglo-irish philosopher the philosophers name is pronounced bark-lee but the citys name to accommodate american english is pronounced berk-lee the college of californias college homestead association planned to raise funds for the new campus by selling off adjacent parcels of land to this end they laid out a plat and street grid that became the basis of berkeleys modern street plan their plans fell far short of their desires and they began a collaboration with the state of california that culminated in 1868 with the creation of the public university of california in 1889 as construction began on the new site more residences were constructed in the vicinity of the new campus at the same time a settlement of residences saloons and various industries grew around the wharf area called ocean view a horsecar ran from temescal in oakland to the university campus along what is now telegraph avenue the first post office opened in 1872 by the 1870s the transcontinental railroad reached its terminus in oakland in 1876 a branch line of the central pacific railroad the berkeley branch railroad was laid from a junction with the mainline called shellmound now a part of emeryville into what is now downtown berkeley that same year the mainline of the transcontinental railroad into oakland was re-routed putting the right-of-way along the bay shore through ocean view there was a strong prohibition movement in berkeley at this time in 1876 the state enacted the mile limit law which forbade sale or public consumption of alcohol within of the new university of california then in 1899 berkeley residents voted to make their city an alcohol-free zone scientists scholars and religious leaders spoke vehemently of the dangers of alcohol on april 1 1878 the people of ocean view and the area around the university campus together with local farmers were granted incorporation by the state of california as the town of berkeley the first elected trustees of the town were the slate of denis kearneys anti-chinese workingmans party who were particularly favored in the working-class area of the former ocean view now called west berkeley during the 1880s berkeley had segregated housing and anti-chinese laws the area near the university became known for a time as east berkeley due to the influence of the university the modern age came quickly to berkeley electric lights and the telephone were in use by 1888 electric streetcars soon replaced the horsecar a silent film of one of these early streetcars in berkeley can be seen at the library of congress website ### early 20th century built in 1917 was designed by john galen howard berkeleys slow growth ended abruptly with the great san francisco earthquake of 1906 the town and other parts of the east bay escaped serious damage and thousands of refugees flowed across the bay among them were most of san franciscos painters and sculptors who between 1907 and 1911 created one of the largest art colonies west of chicago artist and critic jennie v cannon described the founding of the berkeley art association and the rivalries of competing studios and art clubs in 1904 the first hospitals in berkeley were created the alta bates sanatorium today alta bates summit medical center for women and children founded by nurse alta bates on walnut street and the roosevelt hospital later herrick hospital founded by leroy francis herrick on the corner of dwight way and milvia street in 1908 a statewide referendum that proposed moving the california state capital to berkeley was defeated by a margin of about 33000 votes the city named streets around the proposed capitol grounds for california counties they bear those names today a legacy of the failed referendum –style berkeley city club designed by famed architect julia morgan in 1929 on march 4 1909 following public referendums the citizens of berkeley were granted a new charter by the state of california and the town of berkeley became the city of berkeley rapid growth continued up to the crash of 1929 the great depression hit berkeley hard but not as hard as many other places in the us thanks in part to the university in 1916 berkeley implemented single-family zoning as an effort to keep minorities out of white neighborhoods this has been described as the first implementation of single-family zoning in the united states by 2021 nearly half of berkeleys residential neighborhoods were still exclusively zoned for single-family homes on september 17 1923 a major fire swept down the hills toward the university campus and the downtown section around 640 structures burned before a late-afternoon sea breeze stopped its progress allowing firefighters to put it out the next big growth occurred with the advent of world war ii when large numbers of people moved to the bay area to work in the many war industries such as the immense kaiser shipyards in nearby richmond one who moved out but played a big role in the outcome of the war was uc professor and berkeley resident j robert oppenheimer during the war an army base camp ashby was temporarily sited in berkeley the element berkelium was synthesized utilizing the cyclotron at uc berkeley and named in 1949 in recognition of the university thus placing the citys name in the list of elements ### 1940–60s style south berkeley community church b 1943 during the 1940s many african americans migrated to berkeley in 1950 the census bureau reported berkeleys population as 11.7% black and 84.6% white the postwar years brought moderate growth to the city as events on the uc campus began to build up to the recognizable activism of the sixties in the 1950s mccarthyism induced the university to demand a loyalty oath from its professors many of whom refused to sign the oath on the principle of freedom of thought in 1960 a us house committee huac came to san francisco to investigate the influence of communists in the bay area their presence was met by protesters including many from the university meanwhile a number of uc students became active in the civil rights movement finally in 1964 the university provoked a massive student protest by banning distribution of political literature on campus this protest became the free speech movement as the vietnam war rapidly escalated in the ensuing years so did student activism at the university particularly that organized by the vietnam day committee was created via public occupation during the 1960s berkeley protests berkeley is strongly identified with the rapid social changes civic unrest and political upheaval that characterized the late 1960s in that period berkeley—especially telegraph avenue—became a focal point for the hippie movement which spilled over the bay from san francisco many hippies were apolitical drop-outs rather than students but in the heady atmosphere of berkeley in 1967–1969 there was considerable overlap between the hippie movement and the radical left an iconic event in the berkeley sixties scene was a conflict over a parcel of university property south of the contiguous campus site that came to be called peoples park the battle over the disposition of peoples park resulted in a month-long occupation of berkeley by the national guard on orders of then-governor ronald reagan in the end the park remained undeveloped and remains so today a spin-off peoples park annex was established at the same time by activist citizens of berkeley on a strip of land above the bay area rapid transit subway construction along hearst avenue northwest of the uc campus the land had also been intended for development but was turned over to the city by bart and is now ohlone park the era of large public protest in berkeley waned considerably with the end of the vietnam war in 1975 while the 1960s were the heyday of liberal activism in berkeley it remains one of the most overwhelmingly democratic cities in the united states ### 1970s and 1980s ### housing and zoning changes after the 1960s berkeley banned most new housing construction in particular apartments increasing enrollment at the university led to replacement of older buildings by large apartment buildings especially in older parts of the city near the university and downtown increasing enrollment also led the university to wanting to redevelop certain places of berkeley especially southside but more specifically peoples park preservationists passed the neighborhood protection ordinance in 1973 by ballot measure and the landmarks preservation ordinance in 1974 by the city council together these ordinances brought most new construction to a halt facing rising housing costs residents voted to enact rent control and vacancy control in 1980 though more far-reaching in their effect than those of some of the other jurisdictions in california that chose to use rent control where they could these policies were limited by the costa-hawkins rental housing act a statewide ban on rent control that came into effect in 1995 and limited rent control to multi-family units that were built or technically buildings that were issued their original certificate of occupation before the state law came into effect in 1995 for cities such as berkeley where rent control was already in place the law limited the use of rent control to units built before the local rent-control law was enacted ie 1980 ### political movements during the 1970s and 1980s activists increased their power in local government this era also saw major developments in berkeleys environmental and food culture berkeleys last republican mayor wallace j s johnson left office in 1971 alice waters opened chez panisse in 1971 the first curbside recycling program in the us was started by the ecology center in 1973 styrofoam was banned in 1988 as the city leaned more and more democratic local politics became divided between progressives and moderates 1984 saw the progressives take the majority for the first time nancy skinner became the first uc berkeley student elected to city council in 1986 in reaction to the 1984 election a ballot measure switched berkeley from at-large to district-based elections for city council in 1983 berkeleys domestic partner task force was established which in 1984 made policy recommendation to the school board which passed domestic partner legislation the legislation became a model for similar measures nationwide ### 1990s and 2000s in 1995 californias costa–hawkins act ended vacancy control allowing rents to increase when a tenant moved out despite a slow down in 2005–2007 median home prices and rents remain dramatically higher than the rest of the nation fueled by spillover from the san francisco housing shortage and population growth south and west berkeley underwent gentrification with some historically black neighborhoods such as the adeline corridor seeing a 50% decline in black african american population from 1990 to 2010 in the 1990s public televisions frontline documentary series featured race relations at berkeleys only public high school berkeley high school with an economy dominated by the university of california and a high-demand housing market berkeley was relatively unaffected by the great recession state budget cuts caused the university to increase the number of out-of-state and international students with international enrollment mostly from asia rising from 2785 in 2007 to 5951 in 2016 since then more international restaurants have opened downtown and on telegraph avenue including east asian chains such as ippudo and daiso a wave of downtown apartment construction began in 1998 in 2006 the berkeley oak grove protest began protesting construction of a new sports center annex to memorial stadium at the expense of a grove of oak trees on the uc campus the protest ended in september 2008 after a lengthy court process in 2007–2008 berkeley received media attention due to demonstrations against a marine corps recruiting office in downtown berkeley and a series of controversial motions by berkeleys city council regarding opposition to marine recruiting see berkeley marine corps recruiting center controversy ### 2010s and 2020s during the fall of 2010 the berkeley student food collective opened after many protests on the uc berkeley campus due to the proposed opening of the fast food chain panda express students and community members worked together to open a collectively run grocery store right off of the uc berkeley campus where the community can buy local seasonal humane and organic foods the berkeley student food collective still operates at 2440 bancroft way on september 18 2012 berkeley became what may be the first city in the us to officially proclaim a day recognizing bisexuals september 23 which is known as celebrate bisexuality day on september 2 2014 the city council approved a measure to provide free medical marijuana to low-income patients the measure d soda tax was approved by berkeley voters on november 4 2014 the first such tax in the united states ### protests in the fall of 2011 the nationwide occupy wall street movement came to two berkeley locations on the campus of the university of california and as an encampment in civic center park during a black lives matter protest on december 6 2014 police use of tear gas and batons to clear protesters from telegraph avenue led to a riot and five consecutive days and nights of protests marches and freeway occupations in berkeley and oakland afterwards changes were implemented by the police department to avoid escalation of violence and to protect bystanders during protests during a protest against bigotry and us president donald trump in august 2017 anti-fascist protesters grew violent against trump supporters in attendance police intervened arresting 14 people sometimes called antifa these anti-fascist activists were clad in all black while some carried shields and others had masks or bandanas hiding their faces these protests spanned february to september 2017 see more at 2017 berkeley protests in 2019 protesters took up residence in peoples park against tree-chopping and were arrested by police in riot gear many activists saw this as the university preparing to develop the park ### homelessness the city of berkeley has historically been a central location for homeless communities in the bay area since the 1930s the city of berkeley has fostered a tradition of political activism the city has been perceived as a hub for liberal thought and action and it has passed ordinances to oust homeless individuals from berkeley on multiple occasions despite efforts to remove unhoused individuals from the streets and projects to improve social service provision for this demographic homelessness has continued to be a significant problem in berkeley ### 1960s a culture of anti-establishment and sociopolitical activism marked the 1960s the san francisco bay area became a hotspot for hippie counterculture and berkeley became a haven for nonconformists and anarchists from all over the united states most public discourse around homelessness in berkeley at this time was centered around the idea of street-living as an expression of counterculture during the free speech movement in the fall of 1964 berkeley became a hub of civil unrest with demonstrators and uc berkeley students sympathizing with the statewide protests for free speech and assembly as well as revolting against university restrictions against student political activities and organizations established by uc president clark kerr in 1959 many non-student youth and adolescents sought alternative lifestyles and opted for voluntary homelessness during this time in 1969 peoples park was created and eventually became a haven for small-time drug dealers street people and the homeless although the city of berkeley has moved unhoused individuals from its streets sometimes even relocating them to an unused landfill peoples park has remained a safe space for them since its inception the park has become one of the few relatively safe spaces for homeless individuals to congregate in berkeley and the greater bay area ### 1970s stereotypes of homeless people as deviant individuals who chose to live vagrant lifestyles continued to color the discourse around street-dwellers in american cities however this time period was also characterized by a subtle shift in the perception of unhoused individuals the public began to realize that homelessness affected not only single men but also women children and entire families this recognition set the stage for the city of berkeleys attitude towards homelessness in the next decade ### 1980s organizations such as building opportunities for self sufficiency boss were established in 1971 in response to the needs of individuals with mental illness being released to the streets by state hospital closures ### 1990s in the 1990s the city of berkeley faced a substantial increase in the need for emergency housing shelters and saw a rise in the average amount of time individuals spent without stable housing as housing became a more widespread problem the general public berkeley city council and the university of california became increasingly anti-homeless in their opinions in 1994 berkeley city council considered the implementation of a set of anti-homeless laws that the san francisco chronicle described as being among the strictest in the country these laws prohibited sitting sleeping and begging in public spaces and outlawed panhandling from people in a variety of contexts such as sitting on public benches buying a newspaper from a rack or waiting in line for a movie in february 1995 the american civil liberties union aclu sued the city for infringing free speech rights through its proposed anti-panhandling law in may of that same year a federal judge ruled that the anti-panhandling law did violate the first amendment but left the anti-sitting and sleeping laws untouched following the implementation of these anti-sitting and sleeping ordinances in 1998 berkeley increased its policing of homeless adults and youth particularly in the shopping district surrounding telegraph avenue the mayor at that time shirley dean proposed a plan to increase both social support services for homeless youth and enforcement of anti-encampment laws unhoused youth countered this plan with a request for the establishment of the citys first youth shelter more trash cans and more frequent cleaning of public bathrooms ### 21st century the city of berkeleys 2017 annual homeless report and point-in-time count pit estimate that on a given night 972 people are homeless sixty-eight percent 664 people of these individuals are also unsheltered living in places not considered suitable for human habitation such as cars or streets long-term homelessness in berkeley is double the national average with 27% of the citys homeless population facing chronic homelessness chronic homelessness has been on the rise since 2015 and has been largely a consequence of the constrained local housing market in 2015 rent in alameda county increased by 25% while the average household income only grew by 5% the city of berkeleys 2017 report also estimated the number of unaccompanied youth in berkeley at 189 individuals 19% of the total homeless population in the city homeless youth display greater risk of mental health issues behavioral problems and substance abuse than any other homeless age group furthermore homeless youth identifying as lgbtq+ are exposed to greater rates of physical and sexual abuse and higher risk for sexually-transmitted diseases predominantly hiv the city of berkeley has seen a consistent rise in the number of chronically homeless individuals over the past 30 years and has implemented a number of different projects to reduce the number of people living on the streets in 2008 the city focused its efforts on addressing chronic homelessness this led to a 48% decline in the number of chronically homeless individuals reported in the 2009 berkeley pit however the number of hidden homeless individuals those coping with housing insecurity by staying at a friend or relatives residence increased significantly likely in response to rising housing costs and costs of living in 2012 the city considered measures that banned sitting in commercial areas throughout berkeley the measure was met with strong public opposition and did not pass however the city saw a strong need for it to implement rules addressing encampments and public usage of space as well as assessing the resources needed to assist the unhoused population in response to these needs the city of berkeley established the homeless task force headed by then-councilmember jesse arreguín since its formation the task force has proposed a number of different recommendations from expanding the city homeless outreach and mobile crisis teams to building a short-term transitional shelter for unhoused individuals ### geography according to the united states census bureau the citys area includes of land and 40.83% water most of it part of san francisco bay berkeley borders the cities of albany oakland and emeryville and contra costa county including unincorporated kensington as well as san francisco bay berkeley lies within telephone area code 510 until september 2 1991 berkeley was part of the 415 telephone code that now covers only san francisco and marin counties and the postal zip codes are 94701 through 94710 94712 and 94720 for the university of california campus ### geology most of berkeley lies on a rolling sedimentary plain that rises gently from sea level to the base of the berkeley hills east of the hayward fault along the base of the hills elevation increases more rapidly the highest peak along the ridge line above berkeley is grizzly peak at an elevation of a number of small creeks run from the hills to the bay through berkeley cerrito codornices schoolhouse and strawberry creeks are the principal streams most of these are largely culverted once they reach the plain west of the hills the berkeley hills are part of the pacific coast ranges and run in a northwest–southeast alignment exposed in the berkeley hills are cherts and shales of the claremont formation equivalent to the monterey formation conglomerate and sandstone of the orinda formation and lava flows of the moraga volcanics of similar age to the moraga volcanics extinct within the northbrae neighborhood of berkeley are outcroppings of erosion resistant rhyolite these rhyolite formations can be seen in several city parks and in the yards of a number of private residences indian rock park in the northeastern part of berkeley near the arlington marin circle features a large example ### earthquakes berkeley is traversed by the hayward fault zone a major branch of the san andreas fault to the west no large earthquake has occurred on the hayward fault near berkeley in historic times except possibly in 1836 but seismologists warn about the geologic record of large temblors several times in the deeper past the current assessment is that a bay area earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater within the next 30 years is likely with the hayward fault having the highest likelihood among faults in the bay area of being the epicenter moreover like much of the bay area berkeley has many areas of some risk to soil liquefaction with the flat areas closer to the shore at low to high susceptibility the 1868 hayward earthquake did occur on the southern segment of the hayward fault in the vicinity of todays city of hayward this quake destroyed the county seat of alameda county then located in san leandro and it subsequently moved to oakland it was strongly felt in san francisco causing major damage it was regarded as the great san francisco earthquake prior to 1906 it produced a furrow in the ground along the fault line in berkeley across the grounds of the new state asylum for the deaf dumb and blind then under construction which was noted by one early university of california professor although no significant damage was reported to most of the few berkeley buildings of the time the 1868 quake did destroy the vulnerable adobe home of domingo peralta in north berkeley today evidence of the hayward faults creeping is visible at various locations in berkeley cracked roadways sharp jogs in streams and springs mark the faults path however since it cuts across the base of the hills the creep is often concealed by or confused with slide activity some of the slide activity itself however results from movement on the hayward fault a notorious segment of the hayward fault runs lengthwise down the middle of memorial stadium at the mouth of strawberry canyon on the university of california campus photos and measurements show the movement of the fault through the stadium ### climate berkeley has a warm-summer mediterranean climate csb in the köppen climate classification with warm dry summers and cool wet winters berkeleys location directly opposite the golden gate ensures that typical eastward fog flow blankets the city more often than its neighbors the summers are cooler than a typical mediterranean climate thanks to upwelling ocean currents along the california coast these help produce cool and foggy nights and mornings winter is punctuated with rainstorms of varying ferocity and duration but also produces stretches of bright sunny days and clear cold nights it does not normally snow though occasionally the hilltops get a dusting spring and fall are transitional and intermediate with some rainfall and variable temperature summer typically brings night and morning low clouds or fog followed by sunny warm days the warmest and driest months are typically june through september with the highest temperatures occurring in september mid-summer july–august is often a bit cooler due to the sea breezes and fog common then in a year there are an average of 2.9 days with highs of or higher and an average of 0.8 days with lows of or lower the highest recorded temperature was on june 15 2000 and july 16 1993 and the lowest recorded temperature was on december 22 1990 february is normally the wettest month averaging of precipitation average annual precipitation is falling on an average of 63.7 days each year the most rainfall in one month was in february 1998 the most rainfall in 24 hours was on january 4 1982 as in most of california the heaviest rainfall years are usually associated with warm water el niño episodes in the pacific eg 1982–83 1997–98 which bring in drenching pineapple express storms in contrast dry years are often associated with cold pacific la niña episodes light snow has fallen on rare occasions snow has generally fallen every several years on the higher peaks of the berkeley hills in the late spring and early fall strong offshore winds of sinking air typically develop bringing heat and dryness to the area in the spring this is not usually a problem as vegetation is still moist from winter rains but extreme dryness prevails by the fall creating a danger of wildfires in september 1923 a major fire swept through the neighborhoods north of the university campus stopping just short of downtown on october 20 1991 gusty hot winds fanned a conflagration along the berkeley–oakland border killing 25 people and injuring 150 as well as destroying 2449 single-family dwellings and 437 apartment and condominium units ### demographics### 2020

bicycle and pedestrian commuting in the nation berkeley is the safest city of its size in california for pedestrians and cyclists considering the number of injuries per pedestrian and cyclist rather than per capita berkeley has modified its original grid roadway structure through use of diverters and barriers moving most traffic out of neighborhoods and onto arterial streets visitors often find this confusing because the diverters are not shown on all maps berkeley maintains a separate grid of arterial streets for bicycles called bicycle boulevards with bike lanes and lower amounts of car
