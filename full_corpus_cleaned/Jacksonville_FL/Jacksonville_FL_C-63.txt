national timucuan ecological and historic preserve a university of north florida team discovered some of the oldest remnants of pottery in the united states dating to 2500 bce in the 16th century the beginning of the historical era the region was inhabited by the mocama a coastal subgroup of the timucua people at the time of contact with europeans all mocama villages in present-day jacksonville were part of the powerful chiefdom known as the saturiwa centered around the mouth of the st johns river one early french map shows a village called ossachite at the site of what is now downtown jacksonville this may be the earliest recorded name for that area in 1562 french huguenot explorer jean ribault charted the st johns river calling it the river of may because that was the month of his discovery ribault erected a stone column at his landing site near the rivers mouth claiming the newly discovered land for france in 1564 rené goulaine de laudonnière established the first european settlement on the st johns river fort caroline near the main village of the saturiwa philip ii of spain ordered pedro menéndez de avilés to protect the interests of spain by attacking the french at

corps established blount island command jacksonville like most large cities in the united states suffered from many negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after world war ii the construction of federal highways essentially subsidized development of suburban housing and wealthier better established residents moved to newer housing in the suburbs after world war ii the government of the city of jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the postwar economic boom mayor w haydon burns jacksonville story resulted in the construction of a new city hall civic auditorium public library and other projects that created a sense of civic pride development of suburbs led to a growing middle class who lived outside the urban core an increasing proportion of residents in jacksonvilles urban core had a higher than average rate of poverty especially as businesses and jobs also migrated to the suburbs given the postwar migration of residents businesses and jobs the citys tax base declined it had difficulty funding education sanitation and traffic control within the city limits in addition residents in unincorporated suburbs had difficulty obtaining municipal services such as sewage and building code enforcement in 1958 a study recommended the city of jacksonville begin annexing outlying communities to create the needed larger geographic tax base to improve services throughout the county voters outside the city limits rejected annexation plans in six referendums between 1960 and 1965 on august 27 1960 a white mob attacked civil rights

politics for the decades since the disenfranchisement of most african americans at the turn of the 20th century which effectively hollowed out the republican party after a grand jury was convened to investigate 11 officials were indicted and more were forced to resign in 1963 the southern association of colleges and schools threatened to withdraw accreditation of area schools in a year because of instructional deficiencies but voters refused to approve new taxes to improve school conditions in late 1963 duval county was spending $299 per student compared to the state average spending of $372 per student in 1964 all 15 of duval countys public high schools lost their accreditation this added momentum to proposals for government reform jacksonville consolidation led by j j daniel and claude yates began to win more support during this period from both inner-city blacks who wanted more involvement in government after passage of the voting rights act of 1965 that provided federal oversight and enforcement of their right to vote and whites in the suburbs who wanted more services and more control over the central city lower taxes increased economic development unification of the community better public spending and effective administration by a more central authority were all cited as reasons for a new consolidated government when a consolidation referendum was held in 1967 65% of voters approved the plan on october 1 1968 the city and county governments merged to create the consolidated city of jacksonville fire police health & welfare recreation public works and housing &
