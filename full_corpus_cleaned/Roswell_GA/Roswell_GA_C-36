sherman garrard shipped the mill workers north to prevent them from returning to work if the mills were rebuilt this was a common tactic of sherman to economically disrupt the confederate rebellion the mill was burned but the houses were left standing the ruins of the mill and the dam that was built for power still remain most of the towns property was confiscated by union forces the leading families had left the town to go to safer places well before the civil war and arranged for the enslaved people to be taken away from advancing union troops as was often the practice some slaves may have escaped to freedom beyond union lines after the war barrington king rebuilt the mills and resumed production while many freedmen stayed in the area to work as paid labor on plantations or in town
