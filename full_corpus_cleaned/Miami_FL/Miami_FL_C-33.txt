spain and briefly britain ruled florida until it ceded it to the united states in 1821 in 1836 the us built fort dallas on the banks of the miami river as part of their development of the florida territory and their attempt to suppress and remove the seminoles as a result the miami area became a site of fighting in the second seminole war founding miami is noted as the only major city in the united states founded by a woman julia tuttle a local citrus grower and a wealthy cleveland native was the original owner of the land upon which miami was built in the late 19th century the area was known as biscayne bay country and reports described it as a promising wilderness and one of the finest building sites in florida the great freeze of 1894–1895 hastened miamis growth as the crops there were the only ones in florida that survived julia tuttle subsequently convinced railroad tycoon henry flagler to extend his florida east coast railway to the region for which she became known as the mother of miami miami was officially incorporated as a city on july 28 1896 with a population of just over 300 20th century during the early 20th century migrants from the bahamas and

police officers was a member of the ku klux klan unsurprisingly these officers enforced social codes far beyond the written law quigg for example personally and publicly beat a colored bellboy to death for speaking directly to a white woman the collapse of the florida land boom of the 1920s the 1926 miami hurricane and the great depression in the 1930s slowed development when world war ii began miami became a base for us defense against german submarines due to its prime location on the southern coast of florida this brought an increase in miamis population 172172 people lived in the city by 1940 the citys nickname the magic city came from its rapid growth which was noticed by winter visitors who remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic

a major international financial and cultural center it is the second-largest us city with a spanish-speaking majority after el paso texas and the largest city with a cuban-american plurality geography miami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the everglades to the west and biscayne bay to the east which extends from lake okeechobee southward to florida bay the elevation of the area averages at around 6 ft 1.8 m above sea level in most neighborhoods especially near the coast the highest points are found along the miami rock ridge which lies under most of the eastern miami metro the main portion of miami is on the shores of biscayne bay which contains several hundred natural and artificial barrier islands the largest of which contains miami beach and south beach the gulf stream a warm ocean current runs northward just 15 miles 24 km off the coast allowing miamis climate to stay warm and mild all year geology the surface bedrock under the miami area is called miami oolite or miami limestone this bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil and is no more than 50 feet 15 m thick miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glacial periods or ice ages beginning some 130000 years ago the sangamonian stage raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet 8 m above the current level all of southern florida was covered by a shallow sea several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged florida plateau stretching from the present miami area to what is now the dry tortugas the area behind this reef line was a large lagoon miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans starting about 100000 years ago the wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels exposing the floor of the lagoon by 15000 years ago the sea level had dropped 300 to 350 feet 90 to 110 m below the current level the sea level rose quickly after that stabilizing at the current level about 4000 years ago leaving the mainland of south florida just above sea level beneath the plain lies the biscayne aquifer a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern palm beach county to florida bay it comes closest to the surface around the cities of miami springs and hialeah most of the miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from the biscayne aquifer as a result of the aquifer it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20 ft 5 to 6 m beneath the city without hitting water which impedes underground construction though some underground parking garages exist for this reason the mass transit systems in and around miami are elevated or at-grade most of the western fringes of miami border the everglades a tropical marshland

city in the metro hialeah miami has approximately a sixth of the population of its own county miami-dade which is the states largest miami had rapid growth in the first half of the twentieth century its population grew from 1681 in the 1900 census to 249276 in the 1950 census this made it floridas largest city a title it retained until the jacksonville consolidation when the city of jacksonville

experienced a certain amount of stagnation in its population with expansion slowing during the 1950s and 1960s before nearly halting in the next three decades as suburbanization occurred miami grew by

32.9% non-hispanic white and 22.7% black miamis explosive population growth has been driven by internal migration from other parts of the country up until the 1960s from 1970 to 2000 population growth in miami was stagnant as non-hispanic white miamians left and significant immigration from latin america particularly cuba made up the balance miamis hispanic majority solidified itself in this period of time and in 1985 miami elected its first cuban-born mayor xavier suarez the non-hispanic black population of the city of miami peaked in 1990 at almost 90000 making up nearly a quarter of the population of miami since then miamis non-hispanic black population has experienced a precipitous and steady decline in the 2020 census it was 52447 only 11.7% of the population reasons for this include high costs in areas such as liberty city and little haiti compounded with gentrification the non-hispanic white population began to rebound in the twenty-first century as the monolithically hispanic areas in the western and central parts of miami experienced population stagnation this caused them to begin to be outweighed by migration into the downtown region from latin america and the rest of the united states this caused the non-hispanic white population to rise from a nadir of 11.8% at the time of the 2000 census to 11.9% at the time of the 2010 census after this the non-hispanic white population grew significantly faster than miami as a whole did during the 2010s in the 2020 census non-hispanic whites were 14.0% of the population of miami and numbered 61829 the highest number

the corner of flagler street and miami avenue is in the middle of downtown in front of the downtown macys formerly the burdines headquarters the miami grid is primarily numerical so that for example all street addresses north of flagler street and west of miami avenue have nw in their address because its point of origin is in downtown which is close to the coast the nw and sw quadrants are much larger than the se and ne quadrants many roads especially major ones are also named eg tamiami trail sw 8th st although with exceptions the number is in more common usage among locals with few exceptions within this grid north–south roads are designated as courts roads avenues or places often remembered by their acronym while east–west roads are streets terraces drives or occasionally ways major roads in each direction are located at one mile intervals there are 16 blocks to each mile on north–south avenues and 10 blocks to each mile on east–west streets major north–south avenues generally end in 7 – eg 17th 27th 37th douglas aves 57th red rd 67th ludlam 87th galloway etc all the way west beyond 177th krome avenue one prominent exception is 42nd avenue lejeune road located at the half-mile point instead major east–west streets to the south of downtown are multiples of 16 though the beginning point of this system is at sw 8th st one half-mile south of flagler zeroth street thus major streets are at 8th st 24th st coral way 40th st bird 56th miller 72nd sunset 88th n kendall 104th originally s kendall 120th montgomery 136th howard 152nd coral reef 168th richmond 184th
