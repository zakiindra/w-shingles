lived in villages along the platte river the great sioux nation including the ihanktowan-ihanktowana and the lakota to the north and west used nebraska as a hunting and skirmish ground but did not have any long-term settlements in the state an occasional buffalo could still be seen in the plat of lincoln in the 1860s founding lincoln was founded in 1856 as the village of lancaster and became the county seat of the newly created lancaster county in 1859 the village was sited on the east bank of salt creek the first settlers were attracted to the area due to the abundance of salt once j sterling morton developed his salt mines in kansas salt in the village was no longer a viable commodity captain w t donovan a former steamer captain and his family settled on salt creek in 1856 in 1859 the village settlers met to form a county a caucus was formed and the committee which included donovan selected lancaster as the county seat the county was named lancaster after the passage of the 1862 homestead act homesteaders began to inhabit the area the first plat was dated august 6 1864 by the end of 1868 lancaster had a population of approximately 500 the township of lancaster was renamed lincoln with the incorporation of the city of lincoln on april 1 1869 in 1869 the university of nebraska was established in lincoln by the state with a land grant of about 130000 acres construction of university hall the first building began the same year state capital nebraska was granted statehood on march 1 1867 the capital of the nebraska territory had been omaha since the creation of the territory in 1854 most of its population lived south of the platte river after much of the territory south of the platte was considered annexation to kansas the territorial legislature voted to place the capital south of the river and as far west as possible before the vote to remove the capital from omaha omaha senator j n h patrick made a last-ditch effort to derail the move by having the future capital named after recently assassinated president abraham lincoln many of the people south of the platte had been sympathetic to the confederate cause in the recently concluded civil war it was assumed that senators south of the river would not vote to pass the measure if the future capital was named after lincoln in the end the motion to name the future capital lincoln was ineffective in blocking the measure and the vote to move the capital south of the platte was successful with the passage of the removal act in 1867 the removal act called for the formation of a capital commission to site the capital on state-owned land on july 18 1867 the commission composed of governor david butler secretary of state thomas kennard and state auditor john gillespie began to tour sites for the new capital the village of lancaster was chosen in part due to its salt flats and marshes lancaster had approximately 30 residents disregarding the original plat of the village of lancaster kennard platted lincoln on a broader scale the plat of the village of lancaster was not dissolved nor abandoned it became lincoln when the lincoln plat files were finished on september 6

two-story building constructed with native limestone with a central cupola the kennard house built in 1869 is the oldest remaining building in the original plat of lincoln in 1888 a new capitol building was constructed on the site of the first to replace the structurally unsound former capitol the second building was a classical design by architect william h willcox it too had significant structural issues that by the 1920s made clear the need for the construction of a replacement construction began on a third capitol building in 1922 bertram g goodhue was selected in a national competition as its architect by 1924 the first phase of construction was completed and state offices moved into the new building in 1925 the willcox-designed capitol building was razed the goodhue-designed capitol was constructed in four phases with the completion of the fourth phase in 1932 it is the second-tallest capitol building in the united states growth and expansion the worldwide economic depression of 1890 saw lincolns population fall from 55000 to 40169 by 1900 per the 1900 census volga-german immigrants from russia settled in the north bottoms neighborhood and as

common so did the need for better roads in nebraska and throughout the us in 1911 the omaha-denver trans-continental route association with support from the good roads movement established the omaha-lincoln-denver highway o-l-d through lincoln the goal was to have the most efficient highway for travel throughout nebraska from omaha to denver in 1920 the omaha-denver association merged with the detroit-lincoln-denver highway association as a result the o-l-d was renamed the detroit-lincoln-denver highway d-l-d with the goal of having a continuous highway from detroit to denver the goal was eventually realized by the mid-1920s 1700 mi 2700 km of constantly improved highway through six states the auto routes success in attracting tourists led entrepreneurs to build businesses and facilities in towns along the route to keep up with the demand in 1924 the d-l-d was designated as nebraska state highway 6 in 1926 the highway became part of the federal highway system and was renumbered us route 38 in 1931 us 38 was renumbered as a us 6 us 38 overlap and in 1933 the us 38 route designation was dropped in the early years of air travel lincoln had three airports and one
