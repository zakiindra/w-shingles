as thesan dieguito complexwas established in the area at least 9000 years ago 24 thekumeyaaymay have culturally evolved from this complex or migrated into the area around 1000 ce 25 archaeologistmalcolm rogershypothesized that the early cultures of san diego were separate from the kumeyaay yet this claim is disputed with others noting that it does not account forcultural evolution 26 rogers later reevaluated his claims yet they were influential in shaping historical tellings of early san diego history 26 the kumeyaay established villages scattered across the region including the village ofkosaaaywhich was the kumeyaay village that the future settlement of san diego would stem from in todaysold town 21 27 the village of kosaaay was made up of thirty to forty families living in pyramid-shaped housing structures and was supported by a freshwater spring from the hillsides 21 ### spanish period the first european to visit the region was explorerjuan rodríguez

the largest native population in alta california with over 1400 neophytes living in and around the mission proper 33 mission san diego was the southern anchor in alta california of the historic mission trailel camino real both the presidio and the mission arenational historic landmarks 34 35 ### mexican period in 1821 mexicowon its independence from spain and san diego became part of the mexican territory ofalta california in 1822 mexico began its attempt to extend its authority over the coastal territory of alta california the fort on presidio hill was gradually abandoned while the town of san diego grew up on the level land below presidio hill the mission wassecularized by the mexican government in 1834 and most of the mission lands were granted to former soldiers the

grantsexpanded the number ofcalifornia ranchosthat modestly added to the local economy seelist of pre-statehood mayors of san diego however san diego had been losing population throughout the 1830s due to increasing tension between the settlers and the indigenouskumeyaayand in 1838 the town lost its pueblo status because its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents 36 theranchosin the san diego region would face kumeyaay raids in the late 1830s and the town itself would face raids in the 1840s 37 americans gained an increased awareness of california and its commercial possibilities from the writings of two countrymen involved in the often officially forbidden to foreigners but economically significant hide and tallow trade where san diego was a major port and the only one with an adequate harborwilliam shalers journal of a voyage between china and the north-western coast of america made in 1804 andrichard henry danas more substantial and convincing account of his 1834–36 voyage the classictwo years before the mast 38 in 1846 the united states went to war against mexico and sent a naval and landexpedition to conquer alta california at first they had an easy time of it capturing the major ports including san diego but the californios in southern alta california struck back following the successful revolt inlos angeles the american garrison at san diego was driven out without firing a shot in early october 1846 mexican partisans held san diego for three weeks until october 24 1846 when the americans recaptured it for the next several months the americans were blockaded inside the pueblo skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night the californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the americans and their californio supporters out on december 1 the american garrison learned that the dragoons of generalstephen w kearneywere atwarners ranch commodorerobert f stocktonsent a mounted force of fifty under

rescuing kearnys battered and blockaded command 39 stockton and kearny went on to recover los angeles and force the capitulation of alta california with the treaty of cahuenga on january 13 1847 as a result of themexican–american warof 1846–48 the territory of alta california including san diego was ceded to the united states by mexico under the terms of thetreaty of guadalupe hidalgoin 1848 the mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain san diego as part of mexico but the americans insisted that san diego was for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of san francisco and the mexican–american border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point ofsan diego bay so as to include the entire bay within the united states 40 ### american period the state of california was admitted to theunited statesin 1850 that same year san diego was designated the seat of the newly established county of san diego and was incorporated as a cityjoshua h bean the last alcalde of san diego was elected the first mayor two years later the city was bankrupt 41 the california legislature revoked the citys charter and placed it under control of a board of trustees where it remained until 1889 a city charter was reestablished in 1889 and todays city charter was adopted in 1931 42 the original town of san diego was located at the foot of presidio hill in the area which is nowold town san diego state historic park the location was not ideal being several miles away from navigable water at its port atla playa in 1850william heath davispromoted a new development by the bay shore called new san diego several miles south of the original settlement however for several decades the new development consisted only of a pier a few houses and anarmy depotfor the support offort yuma after 1854 the fort became supplied by sea and bysteamboats on the colorado riverand the depot fell into disuse from 1857 to 1860 san diego

territoryin less than 30 days 43 in the late 1860salonzo hortonpromoted a move to the bayside area which he called new town and which becamedowntown san diego horton promoted the area heavily and people and businesses began to relocate to new town because its location onsan diego baywas convenient to shipping new town soon eclipsed the original settlement known to this day asold town and became the economic and governmental heart of the city 44 still san diego remained a relative backwater town until the arrival of a railroad connection in 1878 in 1884–1886john j montgomerymade the first controlled flights by an american in a heavier-than-air unpowered glider just south of san diego at otay mesa helping to pioneer a new science of aerodynamics in 1912 san diego was the site of

significantfree speech fightsduring thewobblyera 47 in 1916 the neighborhood ofstingaree the original home of san diegos firstchinatownand soapbox row was demolished by anti-vicecampaigners to make way for thegaslamp quarter 48 in the early part of the 20th century san diego hosted theworlds fairtwice thepanama–california expositionin 1915 and thecalifornia pacific international expositionin 1935 both expositions were held inbalboa park and many of the spanish baroque-style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park the buildings were intended to be temporary structures but most remained in continuous use until they progressively fell into disrepair most were eventually rebuilt using castings of the original façades to retain the architectural style 49 the menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for thesan diego zoo 50 during the 1950s there was a citywide festival calledfiesta del pacificohighlighting the areas spanish and mexican past 51 in the 2010s there was a proposal for a large-scale celebration of the 100th anniversary of balboa park but the plans were abandoned when the organization tasked with putting on the celebration went out of business 52 the southern portion of thepoint lomapeninsula was set aside for military purposes as early as 1852 over the next several decades thearmyset up a series of coastal artillery batteries and named the areafort rosecrans 53 significant us navy presence began in 1901 with the establishment of the navy coaling station in point loma and expanded greatly during the 1920s 54 by 1930 the city was host tonaval base san diegonaval training center san diegosan diego naval hospitalcamp matthews andcamp kearny nowmarine corps air station miramar the city was also an early center for aviation as early as world war i san diego was proclaiming itself the air capital of the west 55 the city was home to important airplane developers and manufacturers like ryan airlines laterryan aeronautical founded in 1925 andconsolidated aircraft laterconvair founded in 1923 56 charles a lindberghs plane thespirit of st louis was built in san diego in 1927 by ryan airlines 55 duringworld war ii san diego became a major hub of military and defense activity due to the presence of so many military installations and defense manufacturers the citys population grew rapidly during and after world war ii more than doubling between 1930 147995 and 1950 333865 57 during the final months of the war the japanese had a plan to target multiple us cities forbiological attack starting with san diego the plan was called operation cherry blossoms at night and called forkamikazeplanes filled with fleas infected with plague yersinia pestis to crash into civilian population centers in the city hoping to spread plague in the city and effectively kill tens of thousands of civilians the plan was scheduled to launch on september 22 1945 but was not carried out becausejapan surrenderedfive weeks earlier 58 59 60 after world war ii the military continued to play a major role in the local economy but post-cold warcutbacks took a heavy toll on the local defense and aerospace industries the resulting downturn led san diego leaders to seek to diversify the citys economy by focusing on research and science as well as tourism 61 from the start of the 20th century through the 1970s the americantunafishing fleet and tuna canning industry were based in san diego the tuna capital of the world 62 san diegos first tuna cannery was founded in 1911 and by the mid-1930s the canneries employed more than 1000 people a large fishing fleet supported the canneries mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen fromjapan and later from theportugueseazoresanditalywhose influence is still felt in neighborhoods likelittle italyandpoint loma 63 64 due to rising costs and foreign competition the last of the canneries closed in the early 1980s 65 downtown san diego was in decline in the 1960s and 1970s but experienced some urban renewal since the early 1980s including the opening ofhorton plaza the revival of the gaslamp quarter and the construction of thesan diego convention centerpetco parkopened in 2004 66 outside of downtown san diego annexed large swaths of land and for suburban expansion to the north and control of thesan ysidro port of entry as thecold warended the military shrank and so did defense spending san diego has since become a center of the emerging biotech industry and is home to telecommunications giantqualcomm san diego had also grown in the tourism industry with the popularity of attractions such as thesan diego zooseaworld san diego andlegoland californiaincarlsbad 67 ### geography according to sdsu professor emeritus monte marshallsan diego bayis the surface expression of a north-south-trending nestedgraben therose canyonandpoint lomafault zonesare part of thesan andreas faultsystem about 40 miles 64 km east of the bay are thelaguna mountainsin thepeninsular ranges which are part of theamerican cordillera 68 the city lies on approximately 200 deep canyons and hills separating itsmesas creating small pockets of natural open space scattered throughout the city and giving it a hilly geography 69 traditionally san diegans have built their homes and businesses on the mesas while leaving the urban canyons relatively wild 70 thus the canyons give parts of the city a segmented feel creating gaps between otherwise proximate neighborhoods and contributing to a low-density car-centered environment thesan diego riverruns through the middle of san diego from east to west creating a river valley that serves to divide the city into northern and southern segments during the historic period and presumably earlier as well the river has shifted its flow back and forth between san diego bay and mission bay and itsfresh waterwas the focus of the earliest spanish explorersmiguel costansó a cartographer wrote in 1769 when asked by signs where the watering-place was the indians pointed to a grove which could be seen at a considerable distance to the northeast giving to understand that a river or creek flowed through it and that they would lead our men to it if they would follow 71 72 that river was the san diego river 71 several reservoirs andmission trails regional parkalso lie between and separate developed areas of the city notable peaks within the city limits includecowles mountain the highest point in the city at 1591 feet 485 m 9 black mountainat 1558 feet 475 m andmount soledadat 824 feet 251 m thecuyamaca mountainsand laguna mountains rise to the east of the city and beyond the mountains are desert areas thecleveland national forestis a half-hour drive from downtown san diego numerous farms are found in the valleys northeast and southeast of the city ### climate under theköppen–geiger climate classification system the san diego area has been variously categorized as having either ahot semi-arid climate bshin the original classification 74 andbsknin modified köppen classification with the n denoting summer fog 75 or ahot-summer mediterranean climate 76 csa 77 san diegos climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between december and march the city has a mild climate year-round 78 with an average of 201 days above 70 °f 21 °c and low rainfall 9–13 inches 230–330 mm annually the climate in san diego like most of southern california often varies significantly over short geographical distances resulting inmicroclimates in san diego this is mostly because of the citys topography the bay and the numerous hills mountains and canyons frequently particularly during the may gray june gloom period a thick marine layer cloud cover keeps the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast but yields to bright cloudless sunshine approximately 5–10 miles 8–16 km inland 79 sometimes the june gloom lasts into july causing cloudy skies over most of san diego for the entire day 80 81 even in the absence of june gloom inland areas experience much more significant temperature variations than coastal areas where the ocean serves as a moderating influence thus for example downtown san diego averages january lows of 50 °f 10 °c and august highs of 78 °f 26 °c the city ofel cajon just 12 miles 19 km inland from downtown san diego averages january lows of 42 °f 6 °c and august highs of 88 °f 31 °c the average surface temperature of the water at scripps pier in thecalifornia currenthas increased by almost 3 °f 1.7 °c since 1950 according to scientists at thescripps institution of oceanography 82 additionally the mean minimum is now above 40 °f 4 °c putting san diego inhardiness zone11 with the last freeze having occurred many decades ago annual rainfall along the coast averages 10.65 inches 271 mm and the median is 9.6 inches 240 mm 83 the months of december through march supply most of the rain with february the only month averaging 2 inches 51 mm or more the months of may through september tend to be almost completely dry although there are few wet days per month during the rainy period rainfall can be heavy when it does fall rainfall is usually greater in the higher elevations of san diego some of the higher areas can receive 11–15 inches 280–380 mm per year variability from year to year can be dramatic in the wettest years of 1883 1884 and 1940 1941 more than 24 inches 610 mm fell whilst in the driest years there was as little as 3.2 inches 80 mm the wettest month on record is december 1921 with 9.21 inches 234 mm snow in the city is rare having been observed only six times in the century and a half that records have been kept in 1949 and 1967 snow remained on the ground for a few hours in higher locations likepoint lomaandla jolla the other three occasions in 1882 1946 and 1987 involved flurries but no accumulation 84 on february 21 2019 snow fell and accumulated in residential areas of the city but none fell in the downtown area 85 ### ecology like much ofsouthern california the majority of san diegos current area was originally occupied on the west bycoastal sage scruband on the east bychaparral plant communities made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs 90 the steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create a number of different habitats within the city limits includingtidal marshandcanyons the chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone towildfire and the rates of fire increased in the 20th century due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas 91 san diegos broad city limits encompass a number of large nature preserves includingtorrey pines state natural reservelos peñasquitos canyon preserve andmission trails regional park torrey pines state natural reserve and a coastal strip continuing to the north constitute one of only two locations where the rare species of torrey pinepinus torreyana is found 92 due to the steep topography that prevents or discourages building along with some efforts for preservation there are also a large number of canyons within the city limits that serve as nature preserves includingswitzer canyon tecolote canyon natural park 93 and marian bear memorial park insan clemente canyon 94 as well as a number of small parks and preserves san diego county has one of the highest counts of animal and plant species that appear on theendangered listof counties in the united states 95 because of its diversity of habitat and its position on thepacific flyway san diego county has recorded 492 different bird species more than any other region in the country 96 san diego always scores high in the number of bird species observed in the annualchristmas bird count sponsored by theaudubon society and it is known as one of the birdiest areas in the united states 97 98 san diego and its backcountry suffer from periodic wildfires in october 2003 san diego was the site of thecedar fire at that time the largest wildfire in california over the past century 99 the fire burned 280000 acres 1100 km2 killed 15 people and destroyed more than 2200 homes 100 in addition to damage caused by the fire smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits due to asthma respiratory problems eye irritation and smoke inhalation the poor air quality caused san diego county schools to close for a week 101 theoctober 2007 california wildfiresdestroyed some areas particularly withinrancho bernardo as well as the nearby communities ofrancho santa feandramona 95 ### neighborhoods the city of san diego recognizes 52 individual areas as community planning areas

cities ofnational cityandchula vista a narrow strip of land at the bottom of san diego bay connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city 103 for the most part san diego neighborhood boundaries tend to be understood by its residents based on geographical boundaries like canyons and street patterns 104 the city recognized the importance of its neighborhoods when it organized its 2008 general plan around the concept of a city of villages 105 ### cityscape san diego was originally centered on theold towndistrict but by the late 1860s the focus had shifted to the bayfront in the belief that this new location would increase trade as the new town – present-day downtown – waterfront location quickly developed it eclipsed old town as the center of san diego 44 the first skyscraper over 300 feet 91 m in san diego was theel cortez hotel built in 1927 it was the tallest building in the city until 1963 106 as time went on multiple buildings claimed the title of san diegos tallest skyscraper including the530 b streetandsymphony towers currently the tallest building in san diego isone america plaza standing 500 feet 150 m tall which was completed in 1991 107 the downtown skyline contains nosupertallbuildings due to a regulation put in place by thefederal aviation administration faa in the 1970s which set a 500 feet 152 m limit on the height of buildings within a one-mile 1.6 km radius ofsan diego international airport 108 an iconic description of the skyline includes its skyscrapers being compared to the tools of a toolbox 109 there areseveral new
