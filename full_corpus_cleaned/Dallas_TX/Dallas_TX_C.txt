office space several of downtown dallass largest buildings are the fruit of this boom but over-speculation the savings and loan crisis and an oil bust brought the 1980s building boom to an end for dallas as well as its sister city houston between the late 1980s and the early 2000s central dallas went through a slow period of growth however since the early 2000s the central core of dallas has been enjoying steady and significant growth encompassing both repurposing of older commercial buildings in downtown dallas into residential and hotel uses as well as the construction of new office and residential towers the opening of klyde warren park built across woodall rodgers freeway seamlessly connecting the central dallas cbd to uptown victory park has acted synergistically with the highly successful dallas arts district so both have become catalysts for significant new development in central dallas the residential real estate market in the dallas–fort worth metroplex has not only been
