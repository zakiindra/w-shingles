explorations 17 18 antebellum and civil war edit prior to the arrival of the railroad the area now known as durham was the eastern part of present-day orange county and was almost entirely agricultural with a few businesses catering to travelers particularly livestock drivers along the hillsborough road this road eventually followed by us route 70 was the major east–west route in north carolina from colonial times until the construction of interstate highways steady population growth and an intersection with the road connecting roxboro and fayetteville made the area near this site suitable for a us post office roxboro fayetteville and hillsborough roads remain major thoroughfares in durham although they no longer exactly follow their early 19th century rights-of-way 20 large plantations hardscrabble fairntosh lipscomb walnut hall patterson and leigh among them were established in the antebellum period by 1860 stagville plantation lay at the center of one of the largest plantation holdings in the south african slaves were brought to labor on these farms and plantations and slave quarters became the hearth of distinctively southern cultural traditions involving crafts social relations life rituals music and dance there were free african-americans in the area as well including several who fought in the revolutionary war durhams location is a result of the needs of the 19th century railroad industry the wood-burning steam locomotives of the time had to stop frequently for wood and water and the new north carolina railroad needed a depot between the settled towns of raleigh and hillsborough the residents of what is now downtown durham thought their businesses catering to livestock drivers had a better future than a new-fangled nonsense like a railroad and refused to sell or lease land for a depot 21 in 1849 a north carolina railroad depot was established on a four-acre tract of land donated by dr bartlett s durham the station was named after him in recognition of his gift 22 a us post office was established there on april 26 1853 now recognized as the citys official birthday 22 durham station as it was known for its first 20 years was a depot for the occasional passenger or express package until early april 1865 when the federal army commanded by major general william t sherman occupied the nearby state capital of raleigh during the american civil war the last formidable confederate army in the south commanded by general joseph e johnston was headquartered in greensboro 50 miles 80 km to the west after the surrender of the army

23 reconstruction and the rise of durham tobacco edit early view of first duke tobacco factory and family home durham 1883 the community of durham station grew slowly before the civil war but expanded rapidly following the war much of this growth attributed to the establishment of a thriving tobacco industry veterans returned home after the war with an interest in acquiring more of the tobacco they had sampled in north carolina numerous orders were mailed to john ruffin greens tobacco company requesting more of the durham tobacco wt blackwell partnered with green and renamed the company as the bull durham tobacco factory 22 the name bull durham is said to have been taken from the bull on the british colmans mustard which mr blackwell mistakenly believed was manufactured in durham england 24 mustard known as durham mustard was originally produced in durham england by mrs clements and later by ainsley during the eighteenth century however production of the original durham mustard has now been passed into the hands of colmans of norwich england separate white and colored entrances to a cafe in durham north carolina 1940 incorporation edit as durham stations population rapidly increased the station became a town and was incorporated by act of the north carolina general assembly on april 10 1869 it was named for the man who provided the land on which the station was built dr bartlett durham at the time of its incorporation by the general assembly durham was located in orange county the increase in business activity land transfers etc made the day long trip back and forth to the county seat in hillsborough untenable so twelve years later on april 17 1881 a bill for the establishment of durham county was ratified by the general assembly having been introduced by caleb bgreen creating durham county from the eastern portion of orange county and the western portion of wake county in 1911 parts of cedar fork township of wake county was transferred to durham county and became carr township 4 early growth 1900–1970 edit overlooking the newly renovated american tobacco campus the rapid growth and prosperity of the bull durham tobacco company and washington duke s w duke & sons tobacco company resulted in the rapid growth of the city of durham throughout the gilded age and into the early twentieth century durham industrialists including george washington watts john sprunt hill and julian s carr built large mansions such as somerset villa harwood hall the john sprunt hill house and greystone manor washington duke was a good businessman but his sons were brilliant and established what amounted to a monopoly of the smoking and chewing tobacco business in the united states by 1900 in the early 1910s the federal government forced a breakup of the dukes business under the antitrust laws the dukes retained what became known as american tobacco a major corporation in its own right with manufacturing based in durham american tobaccos ubiquitous advertisements on radio shows beginning in the 1930s and television shows up to 1970 was the nations image of durham until duke university supplanted it in the late 20th century looking west along parrish street home of what was then known as black wall street prevented from further investment in the tobacco industry the dukes turned to the then new industry of electric power generation which they had been investing in since the early 1890s duke power now duke energy brought in electricity from hydroelectric dams in the western mountains of north carolina through the newly invented technology of high voltage power lines at this time 1910–1920 the few towns and cities in north carolina that had electricity depended on local powerhouses these were large noisy and smoky coal-fired plants located next to the railroad tracks duke power quickly took over the electricity franchises in these towns and then electrified all the other towns of central and western north carolina making even more money than they ever made from tobacco 25 duke power also had a significant business in local franchises for public transit buses and trolleys before local government took over this responsibility in the mid- to late 20th century duke power ran durhams public bus system now godurham until 1991 the success of the tobacco industry in the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged the then-growing textile industry to locate just outside durham the early electrification of durham was also a large incentive drawing a labor force from the economic demise of single-family farms in the region at the time these textile mills doubled the population of durham these areas were known as east durham and west durham until they were eventually annexed by the city of durham much of the early city architecture both commercial and residential dates from the period of 1890–1930 durham recorded its worst fire in history on march 23 1914 the multimillion-dollar blaze destroyed a large portion of the downtown business district the fire departments water source failed during the blaze prompting voters to establish a city-owned water system in place of the private systems that had served the city since 1887 26 durham quickly developed a black community the center of which was an area known as hayti pronounced hay-tie just south of the center of town where some of the most prominent and successful black-owned businesses in the country during the early 20th century were established these businesses — the best known of which are north carolina mutual life insurance company and mechanics & farmers bank — were centered on parrish st which would come to be known as black wall street 27 in 1910 dr james e shepard founded north carolina central university the nations first publicly supported liberal arts college for african-americans in 1924 james buchanan duke established a philanthropic foundation in honor of his father washington duke to support trinity college in durham the college changed its name to duke university and built a large campus and hospital a mile west of trinity college the original site of trinity college is now known as the duke east campus 28 durhams manufacturing fortunes declined during the mid-20th century textile mills began to close during the 1930s competition from other tobacco companies as well as a decrease in smoking after the 1960s reduced revenues from durhams tobacco industry downtown durham 1942 or earlier in a far-sighted move in the late 1950s duke university along with the university of north carolina in chapel hill and north carolina state university in raleigh persuaded the north carolina legislature to purchase a large tract of sparsely settled land in southern durham county and create the nations first science park for industry cheap land and a steady supply of trained workers from the local universities made the research triangle park an enormous success which along with the expansion resulting from the clinical and scientific advances of duke medical center and duke university more than made up for the decline of durhams tobacco and textile industries 29 30 civil rights movement edit as a result of its substantial african-american community including many activists a prominent civil rights movement developed in durham multiple sit-ins were held and martin luther king jr visited the city during the struggle for equal rights the durham committee on negro affairs organized in 1935 by cc spaulding louis austin conrad pearson and james e shepard has been cited nationally for its role in fighting for black voting rights the committee also has used its voting strength to pursue social and economic rights for african-americans and other ethnic groups in 1957 douglas e moore minister of durhams asbury temple methodist church along with other religious and community leaders pioneered sit-ins throughout north carolina to protest discrimination at lunch counters that served only whites widely

rallying cry fill up the jails during a speech at white rock baptist church advocating non-violent confrontation with segregation laws for the first time king said let us not fear going to jail if the officials threaten to arrest us for standing up for our rights we must answer by saying that we are willing and prepared to fill up the jails of the south this community was not enough to prevent the
