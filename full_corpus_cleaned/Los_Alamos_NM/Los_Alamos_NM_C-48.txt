entrance to los alamos was guarded at the main gate during the manhattan project los alamos post office built in 1948 the ruins of puebloan settlements such as those located in nearby bandelier national monument and tsankawi and numerous other sites such as cliff dwellings indicate that the area has been inhabited during various eras since around 1150 ad the first settlers on the plateau are thought to be keres speaking native americans around the 10th century around 1300 tewa settlers immigrated from the four corners region and built large cities but were driven out within 50 years by navajo and apache raids and by drought in the late 19th century homesteaders utilized the land for ranching most homesteaders built simple log cabins that they only lived in during warm weather to feed livestock many of the homesteaders later moved down to the warmer rio grande valley in 1917 homesteader harold h brook sold part of his land and buildings to ashley pond ii a businessman from detroit who founded the los alamos ranch school the area was used to teach young men basic ranching and other outdoor survival skills in 1943 during world war ii the united states department of war exercised eminent domain over the ranch school and all remaining homesteads in the area so that the relatively isolated location could be used for the secretive manhattan project which ultimately developed the worlds first nuclear weapons 8 facilities for research and development were quickly built and scientists and engineers from all over the world were assigned to the project however all information about the town and project was held secret from the public los alamos was referred to under the code name site y by military personnel and was known only as the hill by many in nearby santa fe los alamos was originally built as a closed city accessible from the outside world through only two gates 9 the specific location of the project was a tightly guarded secret all employees recruited to work at the los alamos site were given a memorandum instructing them to travel to santa fe and report to the us army corps of engineers office at 109 east palace avenue 10 at that location dorothy mckibbin provided newcomers with the necessary documentation to get through security checkpoints initially letters signed by j robert oppenheimer himself and later security passes along with specific directions to the hill 11 the project was further concealed by designating its mailing address as po box 1663 santa fe nm 12 all incoming truckloads were falsely labeled as common items in order to conceal the true nature of their contents and any outbound correspondence by those working and living in los alamos was censored by military officials not until after the bombing of hiroshima in 1945 was information about the manhattan project released to the public being announced by the white house at 11 am on 6 august a set of press releases were given out over three days 13 in the years after world war ii the laboratory was formally established as a research government facility under the civilian control of the us atomic energy commission and is now known as los alamos national laboratory in 1957 the aec pulled back the security perimeter to the laboratory itself and opened up the town for visits by the general public the first visitor to enter the town that year without a permit from the federal government was new mexico governor edwin l mechem 14 the aec was later succeeded by the us department of energy los alamos served as the setting for a large part of the 2023 film oppenheimer 15 however the actual los alamos was mostly used only for shooting interior scenes 15 since the towns appearance had changed drastically since the 1940s the filmmakers
