one of the development and creation places of the atomic bomb —the primary objective of the manhattan project by los alamos national laboratory during world war ii the town is on four mesas of the pajarito plateau and had a population of about 13200 as of 2020 4 it is the county seat and one of two population centers in los alamos county the other is white rock toponym edit los alamos is a spanish place name that typically refers to poplar or cottonwood trees alternatively los alamos could refer to the large groves of quaking aspen that intersperse the coniferous forest on the mountainsides above the townsite where they are distinctly visible in the autumn due to their spectacular autumn colors 5 6 7 history edit the entrance to los alamos was guarded at the main gate during the manhattan project los alamos post office built in 1948 the ruins of puebloan settlements such as those in nearby bandelier national monument and tsankawi and numerous other sites such as cliff dwellings indicate that the area has been inhabited during various eras since around 1150 ad the first settlers on the plateau are thought to be keres -speaking native americans around the 10th century around 1300 tewa settlers immigrated from the four corners region and built large cities but were driven out within 50 years by navajo and apache raids and by drought in the late 19th century homesteaders used the land for ranching about 1899 a road had been blasted up one of the canyons onto the pajarito plateau from buckman on the narrow-gauge chili line railroad for the harvesting of timber which in turn made the plateau more accessible 8 homesteaders built simple log cabins that they lived in only during warm weather to feed livestock many of the homesteaders later moved down to the warmer rio grande valley in 1917 homesteader harold h brook sold part of his land and buildings to ashley pond ii a businessman from detroit who founded the los alamos ranch school the area was used to teach young men basic ranching and other outdoor survival skills in 1943 during world war ii the united states department of war exercised eminent domain over the ranch school and all remaining homesteads in the area so that the relatively isolated location could be used for the secretive manhattan project which developed the first nuclear weapons 9 facilities for research and development were quickly built and scientists and engineers from all over the world were assigned to the project all information about the town and project was held secret from the public los alamos was referred to under the code name site y by military personnel and was known only as the hill by many in nearby santa fe los alamos was originally built as a closed city accessible from the outside world only through two gates 10 the projects location was a tightly guarded secret all employees recruited to work at los alamos were given a memorandum instructing them to travel to santa fe and report to the us army corps of engineers office at 109 east palace avenue 11 there dorothy mckibbin gave newcomers the necessary documentation to get through security checkpoints initially letters signed by j robert oppenheimer and later security passes along with specific directions to the hill 12 the project was further concealed by using the mailing address po box 1663 santa fe nm 13 all incoming truckloads were falsely labeled as common items to conceal the nature of their contents and military officials censored outbound correspondence by those working and living in los alamos not until after the bombing of hiroshima in 1945 was information about the manhattan project released to the public announced by the white house at 11 am on 6 august a set of press releases were given out over three days 14 in the years after world war ii the laboratory was formally established as a research government facility under the civilian control of the us atomic energy commission and is now known as los alamos national laboratory in 1957 the aec pulled back the security perimeter to the laboratory and opened up the town to visits by the general public the first visitor to enter the town that year without a permit from the federal government was new mexico governor edwin l mechem 15 the aec was later succeeded by the us department of energy los alamos served as the setting for much of the 2023 film oppenheimer 16 but mostly for interior scenes 16 the towns appearance had changed drastically since the 1940s so the filmmakers arranged for the construction of a set based on 1940s-era
