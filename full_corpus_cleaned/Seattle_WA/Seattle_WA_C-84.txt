has a history of boom-and-bust cycles like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources seattle has risen several times economically then gone into precipitous decline but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure the first such boom covering the early years of the city rode on the lumber industry during this period the road now known as yesler way won the nickname skid road supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to henry yesler s sawmill the later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider american lexicon as skid row like much of the us west seattle experienced conflicts between labor and management and ethnic tensions that culminated in the anti-chinese riots of 1885–1886 this violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the chinese from seattle anti-chinese riots also occurred in tacoma seattle had achieved sufficient economic success when the great seattle fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district however a far grander city center rapidly emerged in its place finance company washington mutual for example was founded in the immediate wake of the fire the panic of 1893 hit seattle hard the second and most dramatic boom resulted from the klondike gold rush which ended the depression that had begun with the panic of 1893 in a short time seattle became a major transportation center on july 14 1897 the ss portland docked with its famed ton of gold and seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in
