was situated on a narrow north–south passage of water linking the two lakes the river was known as le détroit du lac érié in the french language which means the strait of lake erie in the historical context the strait included the st clair river lake st clair and the detroit river indigenous settlement paleo-indians inhabited areas near detroit as early as 11000 years ago including the culture referred to as the mound builders by the 17th century the region was inhabited by huron odawa potawatomi and iroquois peoples the area is known by the anishinaabe people as waawiiyaataanong translating to where the water curves around the first europeans did not penetrate into the region and reach the straits of detroit until french missionaries and traders worked their way around the iroquois league with whom they were at war in the 1630s the huron and neutral people held the north side of lake erie until the 1650s when the iroquois pushed them and the erie people away from the lake and its beaver -rich feeder streams in the beaver wars of 1649–1655 by the 1670s the war-weakened iroquois laid claim to as far south as the ohio river valley in northern kentucky as hunting grounds and had absorbed many other iroquoian peoples after defeating them in war for the next hundred years virtually no british or french action was contemplated without consultation with the iroquois or consideration of their likely response french settlement on july 24 1701 the french explorer antoine de la mothe cadillac 1658–1730 with his lieutenant alphonse de tonty 1659–1727 and more than a hundred other royal french settlers traveling south and west from new france modern province of quebec along the st lawrence river valley to the great lakes region began constructing a small fort on the north bank of the detroit river cadillac named the settlement fort pontchartrain du détroit after louis phélypeaux comte de pontchartrain 1643–1727 the secretary of state of the navy under king louis xiv 1638–1715 reigned 1643–1715 in the royal government in paris sainte-anne-de-détroit was founded on july 26 and is the second-oldest continuously operating roman catholic parish in the united states france offered free land to colonists to attract families further west into the great lakes region interior of the north american continent to detroit when it eventually reached a population of about 800 by 1765 after the colonial conflict of the french and indian war 1753–1763 seven years war in europe it became the largest european settlement between the important towns of montreal and new orleans both also french settlements in the former colonies of new france and la louisiane further south on the mississippi river on the coast of the gulf of mexico respectively the regions then colonial economy was based on the lucrative fur trade in which numerous native american peoples had important roles as trappers and traders british rule during the french and indian war 1753–63 —the north american front of the seven years war in europe between the kingdom of great britain and the kingdom of france —british troops gained control of the settlement a few years into the conflict in 1760 and shortened its name to detroit several regional native american tribes such as the potowatomi ojibwe and huron launched pontiacs war 1763–1766 and laid siege in 1763 to fort detroit along the detroit river in the great lakes but failed to capture it in defeat france ceded its territory in north america of new france and south of the lakes east of the mississippi to the appalachian mountains to britain following the war when great britain evicted france from its colonial possessions in new france canada in the peace terms of the treaty of paris of 1763 it also removed one barrier to american colonists migrating west across the mountains british negotiations with the iroquois would both prove critical and lead to the royal proclamation of 1763 which limited settlements south of and below the great lakes and west of the alleghenies appalachians many colonists and pioneers in the thirteen colonies along the east coast resented and then simply defied this restraint later becoming supporters of the rebellious american revolution by 1773 after the addition of increasing numbers of the anglo-american settlers the population of detroit and fort detroit was edging up to 1400 doubled in the previous decade during the american revolutionary war 1775–1783 the indigenous and loyalist raids of 1778 and the resultant 1779 decisive sullivan expedition reopened the ohio country north of the ohio river and west of the mountains to even more westward emigration which began almost immediately to get away from the eastern warfare by 1778 its population had doubled again reaching 2144 and it was the third-largest town in what was known then as the province of quebec since the british takeover of former french colonial possessions in north america in 1763 after the american revolutionary war 1775–1783 and the establishment and recognition of the united states as an independent country the great britain ceded detroit and other territories in the interior region of the continent south of the great lakes and west of the appalachian mountains to the mississippi river under the peace of the terms of the 1783 treaty of paris the new northwest territories established the southern border with great britains remaining colonial provinces in british north america and became provinces of upper canada and lower canada however the disputed border area remained under british control with several military forts and trading posts for another decade and its forces did not fully withdraw until 1796 following the negotiations and ratification of the subsequent jay treaty of 1794 between the british and americans by the turn of the 19th century white american settlers began pouring westwards across the appalachians and through the great lakes legacy today the municipal flag of detroit reflects its both its french and english colonial heritage descendants of the earliest french and french-canadian settlers formed a cohesive community who gradually were superseded as the dominant population after more anglo-american settlers arrived in the early 19th century with american westward migration living along the shores of lake st clair and south to monroe and downriver suburbs the ethnic french canadians of detroit also known as muskrat french in reference to the fur trade remain a subculture in the region up into the 21st century post-revolutionary period and 19th century the great detroit fire of 1805 destroyed most of the citys wooden buildings leaving only a stone fort a river warehouse and brick chimneys from former homes despite the extensive damage none of detroits 600 residents perished the aftermath of the fire left a lasting legacy on the citys heritage father gabriel richard coined the city motto speramus meliora resurget cineribus as he surveyed the ruins the city seal designed in 1827 directly depicted the fire by showing two women one grieving the destruction while the other gestures toward a new city rising from the ashes the seal forms the center of detroits flag from 1805 to 1847 detroit served as the capital city of the michigan territory and later became its first state capital in january 1837 after michigans admission to the union during the war of 1812 detroit became a focal point of conflict us army commander william hull surrendered fort detroit without a fight underestimating the number of british forces later the us attempted to retake the fort and town during the battle of frenchtown in january 1813 a significant victory for the british the battle is commemorated at the river raisin national battlefield park near monroe michigan detroit was eventually recaptured later that year detroit was officially incorporated as a city in 1815 and its urban design was influenced by the grand boulevards of washington dc michigan territorial chief justice augustus b woodward who played a key role in the citys development designed a geometric street plan that included wide avenues and plazas in 1817 he founded the catholepistemiad later evolving into the university of michigan in ann arbor michigan detroits growth continued as a center of education and culture for the michigan territory before the american civil war detroits position along the canada-us border made it a vital stop on the underground railroad thousands of enslaved african americans escaped to canada via the city notable activists like george debaptiste william lambert and laura smith haviland played key roles in assisting refugees detroits contributions to the union effort were also significant with many residents volunteering to fight the citys 24th michigan infantry regiment part of the famous iron brigade suffered heavy casualties at the battle of gettysburg the citys tensions over race in tandem with national concerns over the draft led to the detroit race riot of 1863 leaving some dead and over 200 black residents homeless this prompted the establishment of a full-time police force in 1865 in the late 19th century detroit grew as a hub for industry particularly shipping and manufacturing the citys wealth driven by industrial magnates led to the construction of opulent gilded age mansions along the grand avenues designed by woodward detroit earned the nickname paris of the west for its architectural beauty by 1896 henry ford s first automobile was built in the city and detroit expanded its borders annexing surrounding villages and townships as it solidified its place as a key player in the automobile industry early 20th century and world war ii in 1903 henry ford founded the ford motor company alongside automotive pioneers william c durant the dodge brothers james and william packard and walter chrysler they established the big three automakers solidifying detroits status as the worlds automotive capital by the early 20th century the rise of the automotive industry in the united states transformed the city leading to the development of related businesses such as garages gas stations and factories for parts citation needed detroits population grew rapidly reaching the fourth-largest city in the us by 1920 in 1907 the detroit river carried 67 million tons of shipping commerce surpassing both london and new york city in volume this earned the river the title the greatest commercial artery on earth during prohibition in the united states 1920–1933 the detroit river became a major route for smuggling illegal alcohol from canada the booming auto industry and the expansion of shipping trade were central to detroits economic growth in the early 20th century with the rapid growth of industrial workers in the auto factories labor unions such as the american federation of labor and the united auto workers uaw fought to organize workers to gain them better working conditions and wages they initiated strikes and other tactics in support of improvements such as the 8-hour day 40-hour work week increased wages greater benefits and improved working conditions the labor activism during those years increased the influence of union leaders in the city such as jimmy hoffa of the teamsters and walter reuther of the uaw the demographic shifts caused by industrialization led to significant racial tensions in detroit the great migration brought african americans from the south while many southern and eastern european immigrants also moved to the city competition for jobs and housing fueled tensions between different ethnic and racial groups citation needed this period saw the rise of the ku klux klan in detroit which became a powerful force in the city during the 1920s targeting black catholic and jewish communities even after the klans decline the black legion a secret vigilante group continued to spread fear in the 1930s in the 1940s the worlds first urban depressed freeway ever built the davison was constructed systemic racial discrimination remained prevalent in detroit with restrictive housing covenants and violence against black neighborhoods like black bottom and paradise valley the citys racial tensions boiled over during the 1943 detroit race riot sparked by a protest at the packard plant the riot resulted in 34 deaths 433 injuries and widespread property damage during world war ii the government encouraged retooling of the automobile industry in support of the allied powers leading to detroits key role in the american arsenal of democracy jobs expanded so rapidly due to the defense buildup in world war ii that 400000 people migrated to the city from 1941 to 1943 including 50000 blacks in the second wave of the great migration and 350000 whites many of them from the south whites including ethnic europeans feared black competition for jobs and scarce housing the federal government prohibited discrimination in defense work but when in june 1943 packard promoted three black people to work next to whites on its assembly lines 25000 white workers walked off the job late 20th century racial tension and decline industrial mergers in the 1950s especially in the automobile sector increased oligopoly in the american auto industry detroit saw the consolidation of companies like packard and hudson which eventually disappeared at its peak in the 1950 census detroit was the fifth-largest us city with a population of 1.85 million in 1950 the city held about one-third of the states population over the next 60 years the citys population declined to less than 10 percent of the states population the sprawling metropolitan area grew to contain more than half of michigans population during the same time period the citys auto industry which made up 60% of its economy continued to offer employment opportunities especially for african americans migrating from the south to escape jim crow laws while the migration brought higher employment rates with a 103% increase in black workers racial discrimination persisted in employment and housing black detroiters often held lower-paying factory jobs while city services and better-paying positions remained largely dominated by white residents discriminatory policies such as redlining limited black access to housing and financial services forcing many into overcrowded unsafe neighborhoods white residents and political leaders resisted integration reinforcing a cycle of exclusion and segregation as in other major american cities in the postwar era urban planning and infrastructure changes also impacted detroits racial dynamics the construction of highways and freeways in the postwar era displaced many black communities including historically significant neighborhoods like black bottom and paradise valley these areas vital for black businesses and culture were demolished for urban renewal projects exacerbating the displacement of low-income residents with little consideration for the community impact the city also saw a shift in its transportation system as detroits last electric streetcar line was replaced with buses in 1956 this change alongside the rise of suburbanization and the relocation of industries to the outskirts favored car-dependent low-density development by the 21st century detroits sprawling metro area had developed into one of the most spread-out job markets in the us contributing to a decline in detroits population and eroding its tax base as jobs moved beyond the reach of urban low-income workers the detroit walk to freedom civil rights march occurred in june 1963 martin luther king jr gave a major speech that foreshadowed his i have a dream speech in washington dc two months later while the civil rights movement gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965 longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner-city black youth who wanted change longstanding tensions in detroit culminated in the twelfth street riot in july 1967 governor george w romney ordered the michigan national guard into detroit and president lyndon b johnson sent in us army troops the result was 43 dead 467 injured over 7200 arrests and more than 2000 buildings destroyed mostly in black residential and business areas thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods the affected district lay in ruins for decades according to the chicago tribune it was the 3rd most costly riot in the united states in 1970 the naacp filed a lawsuit against michigan state officials including governor william milliken alleging de facto segregation in detroits public schools the lawsuit argued that although schools were not legally segregated policies in detroit and surrounding counties maintained racial segregation through housing practices as school demographics mirrored segregated neighborhoods the district court ruled in favor of the naacp but in the landmark 1974 milliken v bradley decision the us supreme court limited the scope of desegregation ruling that suburban areas could not be forced to aid in detroits school desegregation amid these challenges detroit elected coleman young as its first black mayor in 1973 young focused on increasing racial diversity in city services and improving detroits transportation system although regional tensions with suburban leaders persisted in 1976 a federal grant for a regional rapid transit system failed due to conflicts over planning leaving detroit to develop its own detroit people mover system the citys struggles were exacerbated by the 1973 and 1979 oil crises which hurt the auto industry and led to layoffs and plant closures further diminishing the citys tax base despite efforts to revitalize the city such as the opening of the renaissance center in 1977 downtown detroit continued to lose businesses to suburban areas middle-class flight high unemployment and increased crime worsened the citys conditions with abandoned buildings and neighborhoods further contributing to its decline youngs focus on downtown development was criticized as insufficient in addressing the broader social and economic challenges faced by the citys residents in 1993 young retired as detroits longest-serving mayor and was succeeded by dennis archer archer

sentenced to 28 years in prison his actions cost the city an estimated $20 million in 2011 about half of detroits 305000 property owners failed to pay their taxes leaving approximately $246 million ~$329 million in 2023 uncollected michigan took control of detroits government after the city faced a $327 million deficit and over $14 billion in debt governor rick snyder declared a financial emergency in march 2013 and the city was relying on bond money to stay afloat with unpaid days off for workers underfunded services and failed turnaround efforts led to the appointment of an emergency manager in june 2013 detroit defaulted on $2.5 billion in debt and on july 18 it became the largest us city to file for bankruptcy detroit exited bankruptcy in december 2014 cutting $7 billion in debt and investing $1.7 billion in services the detroit institute of arts holding over 60000 artworks worth billions became a private organization to help fund the citys recovery after legal battles

renovated and adapted as condominiums hotels offices or for cultural uses detroit was mentioned as a city of renaissance and has reversed many of the trends of the prior decades the city has seen a rise in gentrification in some neighborhoods in downtown for example the construction of little caesars arena brought with it high class shops and restaurants along woodward avenue office tower and
