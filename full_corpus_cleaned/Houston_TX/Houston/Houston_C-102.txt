the fifth-most populous metropolitan statistical area in the united states and the second-most populous in texas after dallas–fort worth with a population of 2314157 in 2023 2 houston is the fourth-most populous city in the united states after new york city los angeles and chicago and the sixth-most populous city in north america houston is the southeast anchor of the greater megaregion known as the texas triangle 8 comprising a land area of 640.4 square miles 1659 km 2 9 houston is the ninth-most expansive city in the united states including consolidated city-counties it is the largest city in the united states by total area whose government is not consolidated with a county parish or borough though primarily in harris county small portions of the city extend into fort bend and montgomery counties bordering other principal communities of greater houston such as sugar land and the woodlands houston was founded by land investors on august 30 1836 10 at the confluence of buffalo bayou and white oak bayou a point now known as allens landing and incorporated as a city on june 5 1837 11 12 the city is named after former general sam houston who was president of the republic of texas and had won texass independence from mexico at the battle of san jacinto 25 miles 40 km east of allens landing 12 after briefly serving as the capital of the texas republic in the late 1830s houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for the remainder of the 19th century 13 the 20th century brought a convergence of economic factors that fueled rapid growth in houston including a burgeoning port and railroad industry the decline of galveston as texass primary port following a devastating 1900 hurricane the subsequent construction of the houston ship channel and the texas oil boom 13 in the mid-20th century houstons economy diversified as it became home to the texas medical center —the worlds largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions—and nasa s johnson space center home to the mission control center since the late 19th century houstons economy has had a broad industrial base in energy manufacturing aeronautics and transportation leading in healthcare sectors and building oilfield equipment houston has the second-most fortune 500 headquarters of any us municipality within its city limits 14 15 the port of houston ranks first in the united states in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled 16 nicknamed the bayou city space city h-town and the 713 houston has become a global city with strengths in culture medicine and research the citys population comprises various ethnic and religious backgrounds as well as a large and growing international community houston is the most diverse metropolitan area in texas and has been described as the most racially and ethnically diverse major city in the us 17 18 it is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits such as the houston museum district and the houston theater district 19 ## history present-day houston sits on land that was once occupied by the karankawa and the atakapa indigenous peoples for at least 2000 years before the first known settlers arrived 20 21 22 these tribes are almost nonexistent today this was most likely caused by foreign disease and competition with various settler groups in the 18th and 19th centuries 23 however the land then remained largely uninhabited from the late 1700s until settlement in the 1830s 24 ## early settlement to the 20th century the allen brothers— augustus chapman and john kirby —explored town sites on buffalo bayou and galveston bay according to historian david mccomb the brothers on august 26 1836 bought from elizabeth e parrott wife of tfl parrott and widow of john austin the south half of the lower league 2214-acre 896 ha tract granted to her by her late husband they paid $5000 total but only $1000 of this in cash notes made up the remainder this was financed by assets inherited by augustuss wife charlotte baldwin allen 25 the allen brothers ran their first advertisement for houston just four days later in the telegraph and texas register naming the notional town in honor of sam houston who would become president later that year 12 they successfully lobbied the republic of texas congress to designate houston as the temporary capital agreeing to provide the new government with a state capitol building 26 about a dozen persons resided in the town at the beginning of 1837 but that number grew to about 1500 by the time the texas congress convened in houston for the first time that may 12 the republic of texas granted houston incorporation on june 5 1837 as james s holman became its first mayor 12 in the same year houston became the county seat of harrisburg county now harris county 27 in 1839 the republic of texas relocated its capital to austin the town suffered another setback that year when a yellow fever epidemic claimed about one life for every eight residents yet it persisted as a commercial center forming a symbiosis with its gulf coast port galveston landlocked farmers brought their produce to houston using buffalo bayou to gain access to galveston and the gulf of mexico houston merchants profited from selling staples to farmers and shipping the farmers produce to galveston 12 the great majority of enslaved people in texas came with their owners from the older slave states sizable numbers however came through the domestic slave trade new orleans was the center of this trade in the deep south but slave dealers were in houston thousands of enslaved black people lived near the city before the american civil war many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations 28 while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs 29 in 1840 the community established a chamber of commerce in part to promote shipping and navigation at the newly created port on buffalo bayou 30 by 1860 houston had emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton 27 railroad spurs from the texas inland converged in houston where they met rail lines to the ports of galveston and beaumont during the american civil war houston served as a headquarters for confederate major general john b magruder who used the city as an organization point for the battle of galveston 31 after the civil war houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the citys extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of galveston by 1890 houston was the railroad center of texas 32 in 1900 after galveston was struck by a devastating hurricane efforts to make houston into a viable deep-water port were accelerated 33 the following year the discovery of oil at the spindletop oil field near beaumont prompted the development of the texas petroleum industry 34 in 1902 president theodore roosevelt approved a $1 million improvement project for the houston ship channel by 1910 the citys population had reached 78800 almost doubling from a decade before african americans formed a large part of the citys population numbering 23929 people which was nearly one-third of houstons residents 35 president woodrow wilson opened the deep-water port of houston in 1914 seven years after digging began by 1930 houston had become texass most populous city and harris county the most populous county 36 in 1940 the us census bureau reported houstons population as 77.5% white and 22.4% black 37 ## world war ii to the late 20th century when world war ii started tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended however the war did provide economic benefits for the city petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war 38 ellington field initially built during world war i was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators 39 the brown shipbuilding company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the us navy during world war ii due to the boom in defense jobs thousands of new workers migrated to the city both black and white people competing for the higher-paying jobs president roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense contractors and black people gained some opportunities especially in shipbuilding although not without resistance from white people and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence economic gains of black people who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years 40 in 1945 the md anderson foundation formed the texas medical center after the war houstons economy reverted to being primarily port-driven in 1948 the city annexed several unincorporated areas more than doubling its size houston proper began to spread across the region 12 41 in 1950 the availability of air conditioning provided impetus for many companies to relocate to houston where wages were lower than those in the north this resulted in an economic boom and produced a key shift in the citys economy toward the energy sector 42 43 the increased production of the expanded shipbuilding industry during world war ii spurred houstons growth 44 as did the establishment in 1961 of nasas manned spacecraft center renamed the lyndon b johnson space center in 1973 this was the stimulus for the development of the citys aerospace industry the astrodome nicknamed the eighth wonder of the world 45 opened in 1965 as the worlds first indoor domed sports stadium during the late 1970s houston had a population boom as people from the rust belt states moved to texas in large numbers 46 the new residents came for numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry created as a result of the arab oil embargo with the increase in professional jobs houston has become a destination for many college-educated persons most recently including african americans in a reverse great migration from northern areas in 1997 houstonians elected lee p brown as the citys first african american mayor 47 ## early 21st century houston has continued to grow into the 21st century with the population increasing 15.7% from 2000 to 2022 48 oil and gas have continued to fuel houstons economic growth with major oil companies including phillips 66 conocophillips occidental petroleum halliburton and exxonmobil having their headquarters in the houston area in 2001 enron corporation a houston company with $100 billion in revenue became engulfed in an accounting scandal which bankrupted the company in 2001 49 healthcare has emerged as a major industry in houston the texas medical center is now the largest medical complex in the world and employs over 120000 people 50 three new sports stadiums opened downtown in the first decade of the 21st century in 2000 the houston astros opened their new baseball stadium minute maid park in downtown adjacent to the old union station the houston texans were formed in 2002 as an nfl expansion team replacing the houston oilers which had left the city in 1996 nrg stadium opened the same year in 2003 the toyota center opened as the home for the houston rockets in 2005 the houston dynamo soccer team was formed in 2017 the houston astros won their first world series flooding has been a recurring problem in the houston area in june 2001 tropical storm allison dumped up to 40 inches 1000 mm of rain on parts of houston causing what was then the worst flooding in the citys history and billions of dollars in damage and killed 20 people in texas 51 in august 2005 houston became a shelter to more than 150000 people from new orleans who evacuated from hurricane katrina 52 one month later about 2.5 million houston-area residents evacuated when hurricane rita approached the gulf coast leaving little damage to the houston area this was the largest urban evacuation in the history of the united states 53 54 in may 2015 seven people died after 12 inches of rain fell in 10 hours during what is known as the memorial day flood eight people died in april 2016 during a storm that dropped 17 inches of rain 55 the worst came in late august 2017 when hurricane harvey stalled over southeastern texas much like tropical storm allison did sixteen years earlier causing severe flooding in the houston area with some areas receiving over 50 inches 1300 mm of rain 56 the rainfall exceeded 50 inches in several areas locally breaking the national record for rainfall the damage for the houston area was estimated at up to $125 billion us dollars 57 and was considered to be one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the united states 58 with the death toll exceeding 70 people houstons lack of zoning laws allowed unregulated building of residential homes and other structures in flood-prone areas 59 however it also resulted in more concentrated development in already urban areas than in wetlands and suburbs 60 mayor sylvester turner tweeted of hurricane harvey that zoning wouldnt have changed anything we would have been a city with zoning that flooded 61 on may 16 2024 a strong derecho caused widespread damage across the city and surrounding metropolitan area 62 63 64 ## geography houston is 165 miles 266 km east of austin 65 88 miles 142 km west of the louisiana border 66 and 250 miles 400 km south of dallas 67 the city has a total area of 637.4 square miles 1651 km 2 9 this comprises over 599.59 square miles 1552.9 km 2 of land and 22.3 square miles 58 km 2 covered by water 68 most of houston is on the gulf coastal plain and its vegetation is classified as western gulf coastal grasslands while further north it transitions into a subtropical jungle the big thicket much of the city was built on forested land marshes or swamps and all are still visible in surrounding areas 69 flat terrain and extensive greenfield development have combined to worsen flooding 70 downtown stands about 50 feet 15 m above sea level 71 and the highest point in far northwest houston is about 150 feet 46 m in elevation 72 the city once relied on groundwater for its needs but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground-level water sources such as lake houston lake conroe and lake livingston 12 73 the city owns surface water rights for 1.20 billion us gallons 4.5 gl of water a day in addition to 150 million us gallons 570 ml a day of groundwater 74 houston has four major bayous passing through the city that accept water from the extensive drainage system buffalo bayou runs through downtown and the houston ship channel and has three tributaries white oak bayou which runs through the houston heights community northwest of downtown and then towards downtown brays bayou which runs along the texas medical center 75 and sims bayou which runs through the south of houston and downtown houston the ship channel continues past galveston and then into the gulf of mexico 38 ## geology houston is a flat marshy area where an extensive drainage system has been built the adjoining prairie land drains into the city which is prone to flooding 76 underpinning houstons land surface are unconsolidated clays clay shales and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep the regions geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the rocky mountains these sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter that over time transformed into oil and natural gas beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite a rock salt the porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward as it pushed upward the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands the thick rich sometimes black surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow 77 78 the houston area has over 150 active faults estimated to be 300 active faults with an aggregate length of up to 310 miles 500 km 79 80 81 including the long point–eureka heights fault system which runs through the center of the city land in some areas southeast of houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years it may be associated with slip along the faults however the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves 82 these faults also tend to move at a smooth rate in what is termed fault creep 73 which further reduces the risk of an earthquake ## cityscape the city of houston was incorporated in 1837 and adopted a ward system of representation shortly afterward in 1840 83 the six original wards of houston are the progenitors of the 11 modern-day geographically oriented houston city council districts though the city abandoned the ward system in 1905 in favor of a commission government and later the existing mayor–council government locations in houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the interstate 610 loop the inner loop encompasses a 97-square-mile 250 km 2 area which includes downtown pre–world war ii residential neighborhoods and streetcar suburbs and newer high-density apartment and townhouse developments 84 outside the loop the citys typology is more suburban though many major business districts—such as uptown westchase and the energy corridor —lie well outside the urban core in addition to interstate 610 two additional loop highways encircle the city beltway 8 with a radius of approximately 10 miles 16 km from downtown and state highway 99 the grand parkway with a radius of 25 miles 40 km approximately 470000 people lived within the interstate 610 loop while 1.65 million lived between interstate 610 and beltway 8 and 2.25 million lived within harris county outside beltway 8 in 2015 85 though houston is the largest city in the united states without formal zoning regulations it has developed similarly to other sun belt cities because the citys land use regulations and legal covenants have played a similar role 86 87 regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers in 1998 houston relaxed its mandatory lot sizes from 5000 square feet to 3500 square feet which spurred housing construction in the city dramatically 88 such restrictions have had mixed results though some have blamed the citys low density urban sprawl and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies others have credited the citys land use patterns with providing significant affordable housing sparing houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis the city issued 42697 building permits in 2008 and was ranked first in the list of healthiest housing markets for 2009 89 in 2019 home sales reached a new record of $30 billion 90 in referendums in 1948 1962 and 1993 voters rejected efforts to establish separate residential and commercial land-use districts consequently rather than a single central business district as the center of the citys employment multiple districts and skylines have grown throughout the city in addition to downtown which include uptown the texas medical center midtown greenway plaza memorial city the energy corridor westchase and greenspoint 91 ## architecture houston had the fifth-tallest skyline in north america after new york city chicago toronto and miami and 36th-tallest in the world in 2015 92 a seven-mile 11 km system of tunnels and skywalks links downtown buildings containing shops and restaurants enabling pedestrians to avoid summer heat and rain while walking between buildings in the 1960s downtown houston consisted of a collection of mid-rise office structures downtown was on the threshold of an energy industry–led boom in 1970 a succession of skyscrapers was built throughout the 1970s—many by real estate developer gerald d hines —culminating with houstons tallest skyscraper the 75-floor 1002-foot 305 m -tall jpmorgan chase tower formerly the texas commerce tower completed in 1982 it is the tallest structure in texas 19th tallest building in the united states and was previously 85th-tallest skyscraper in the world based on highest architectural feature in 1983 the 71-floor 992-foot 302 m -tall wells fargo plaza formerly allied bank plaza was completed becoming the second-tallest building in houston and texas based on highest architectural feature it is the 21st-tallest in the united states in 2007 downtown had over 43 million square feet 4000000 m 2 of office space 93 centered on post oak boulevard and westheimer road the uptown district boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of midrise office buildings hotels and retail developments appeared along i-610 west uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city the tallest building in uptown is the 64-floor 901-foot 275 m -tall philip johnson and john burgee designed landmark williams tower known as the transco tower until 1999 at the time of construction it was believed to be the worlds tallest skyscraper outside a central business district the new 20-story skanska building 94 and bbva compass plaza 95 are the newest office buildings built in uptown after 30 years the uptown district is also home to buildings designed by noted architects i m pei césar pelli and philip johnson in the late 1990s and early 2000s a mini-boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction occurred with several over 30 stories tall 96 97 98 since 2000 over 30 skyscrapers have been developed in houston all told 72 high-rises tower over the city which adds up to about 8300 units 99 in 2002 uptown had more than 23 million square feet 2100000 m 2 of office space with 16 million square feet 1500000 m 2 of class a office space 100 ## climate houstons climate is classified as humid subtropical cfa in the köppen climate classification system typical of the southern united states while not in tornado alley like much of northern texas spring supercell thunderstorms sometimes bring tornadoes to the area 101 prevailing winds are from the south and southeast during most of the year which bring heat and tropical moisture from the nearby gulf of mexico and galveston bay 102 during the summer temperatures reach or exceed 90 °f 32 °c an average of 106.5 days per year including a majority of days from june to september additionally an average of 4.6 days per year reach or exceed 100 °f 37.8 °c 103 houstons characteristic subtropical humidity often results in a higher apparent temperature and summer mornings average over 90% relative humidity 104 air conditioning is ubiquitous in houston in 1981 annual spending on electricity for interior cooling exceeded $600 million equivalent to $2.08 billion in 2024 and by the late 1990s approximately 90% of houston homes featured air conditioning systems 105 106 the record highest temperature recorded in houston is 109 °f 43 °c at bush intercontinental airport on four occasions september 4 2000 august 27 2011 and august 24 and august 27 2023 103 houston has mild winters with occasional cold spells in january the normal mean temperature at george bush intercontinental airport is 53 °f 12 °c with an average of 13 days per year with a low at or below 32 °f 0 °c occurring on average between december 3 and february 20 allowing for a growing season of 286 days 103 twenty-first century snow events in houston include a storm on december 24 2004 which saw 1 inch 3 cm of snow accumulate in parts of the metro area 107 and an event on december 7 2017 which precipitated 0.7 inches 2 cm of snowfall 108 109 snowfalls of at least 1 inch 2.5 cm on both december 10 2008 and december 4 2009 marked the first time measurable snowfall had occurred in two consecutive years in the citys recorded history overall houston has seen measurable snowfall 38 times between 1895 and 2018 on february 14 and 15 1895 houston received 20 inches 51 cm of snow its largest snowfall from one storm on record 110 the coldest temperature officially recorded in houston was 5 °f −15 °c on january 18 1930 103 the last time houston saw single digit temperatures was on december 23 1989 the temperature dropped to 7 °f −14 °c at bush airport marking the coldest temperature ever recorded there 1.7 inches of snow fell at george bush intercontinental airport the previous day 111 houston generally receives ample rainfall averaging about 49.8 in 1260 mm annually based on records between 1981 and 2010 many parts of the city have a high risk of localized flooding due to flat topography 112 ubiquitous low- permeability clay-silt prairie soils 113 and inadequate infrastructure 112 during the mid-2010s greater houston experienced consecutive major flood events in 2015 memorial day 114 2016 tax day 115 and 2017 hurricane harvey 116 overall there have been more casualties and property loss from floods in houston than in any other locality in the united states 117 the majority of rainfall occurs between april and october the wet season of southeast texas when the moisture from the gulf of mexico evaporates extensively over the city 114 117 houston has excessive ozone levels and is routinely ranked among the most ozone-polluted cities in the united states 118 ground-level ozone or smog is houstons predominant air pollution problem with the american lung association rating the metropolitan areas ozone level twelfth on the most polluted cities by ozone in 2017 after major cities such as los angeles phoenix new york city and denver 119 the industries along the ship channel are a major cause of the citys air pollution 120 the rankings are in terms of peak-based standards focusing strictly on the worst days of the year the average ozone levels in houston are lower than what is seen in most other areas of the country as dominant winds ensure clean marine air from the gulf 121 excessive man-made emissions in the houston area led to a persistent increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide over the city such an increase often regarded as co 2 urban dome is driven by a combination of strong emissions and stagnant atmospheric conditions moreover houston is the only metropolitan area with less than ten million citizens where such a co 2 dome can be detected by satellites 122 climate data

hurricane harvey mayor sylvester turner of houston initiated plans to require developers to build homes that will be less susceptible to flooding by raising them two feet above the 500-year floodplain hurricane harvey damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and dumped trillions of gallons of water into the city 129 in places this led to feet of standing water that blocked streets and flooded homes the houston city council passed this regulation in 2018 with a vote of 9–7 had these floodplain development rules had been in place all along it is estimated that 84% of homes in the 100-year and 500-year floodplains would have been spared damage dubious – discuss 129 in a recent case testing these regulations near the brickhouse gulley an old golf course that long served as a floodplain and reservoir for floodwaters announced a change of heart toward intensifying development 130 a nationwide developer meritage homes bought the land and planned to develop the 500-year floodplain into 900 new residential homes their plan would bring in $360 million in revenue and boost city population and tax revenue in order to meet the new floodplain regulations the developers needed to elevate the lowest floors two feet above the 500-year floodplain equivalent to five or six feet above the 100-year base flood elevation and build a channel to direct stormwater runoff toward detention basins before hurricane harvey the city had bought $10.7 million in houses in this area specifically to take them out of danger in addition to developing new streets and single-family housing within a floodplain a flowing flood-water stream termed a floodway runs through the development area a most dangerous place to encounter during any future flooding event 131 under texas law harris county like other more rural texas counties cannot direct developers where to build or not build via land use controls such as a zoning ordinance and instead can only impose general floodplain regulations for enforcement during subdivision approvals and building permit approvals 131 ## demographics census | pop | note | %± 1850 | 2396 | | — 1860 | 4845 | | 102.2% 1870 | 9382 | | 93.6% 1880 | 16513 | |
