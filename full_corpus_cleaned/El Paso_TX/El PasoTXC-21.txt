base for spanish governance of the territory of new mexico as a result of thepueblo revolt until 1692 whensanta fewas reconquered and once again became the capital 28 thetexas revolution 1836 was generally not felt in the region as the american population was small not more than 10% of the population however the region was claimed by texas as part of the treaty signed with mexico and numerous attempts were made by texas to bolster these claims but the villages that consisted of what is now el paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the mexican and texan governments negotiating for control until texas havingbecome a us state in 1845 irrevocably took control in 1846 29 during this interregnum 1836–1848 americans nonetheless continued to settle the region as early as the mid-1840s alongside long extant hispanic settlements such as the rancho de juan maría ponce de león anglo-american settlers such assimeon hartandhugh stephensonhad established thriving communities of american settlers owing allegiance to texas 29 stephenson who had married into the local hispanic aristocracy established therancho de san josé de la concordia which became the nucleus of anglo-american and hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day el paso in 1844 the republic of texas which claimed the area wanted a chunk of the santa fe trade during themexican–american war thebattle of el bracitowas fought nearby on christmas day 1846 thetreaty of guadalupe hidalgoeffectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the us separate from old el paso del norte on the mexican side 29 the present new mexico–texas boundary placing el paso on the texas side was drawn in thecompromise of 1850 30 31 el paso remained the largest settlement in new mexico as part of the republic of mexico until its cession to the us in 1848 when the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo specified the border was to run north of el paso de norte around theciudad juárez cathedralwhich became part of the state of chihuahua 32 el paso countywas established in march 1850 withsan elizarioas the first county seat 33 the united states

34 inbeyond the mississippi 1867 albert d richardson traveling to california via coach described el paso as he found it in late 1859 the texan town of el paso had four hundred inhabitants chiefly mexicans its businessmen were americans but spanish was the prevailing language all the features were mexican low flat adobe buildings shading cottonwoods under which dusky smoking women and swarthy children sold fruit vegetables and bread habitual gambling universal from the boys game of pitchingquartillas three-cent coins to the great saloons where huge piles of silver dollars were staked at monte in this little village a hundred thousand dollars often changed hands in a single night through the potent agencies of monte and poker there were only two or three american ladies and most of the whites kept mexican mistresses all goods were brought on wagons from the gulf of mexico and sold at an advance of three or four hundred percent on eastern prices 35 from hills overlooking the town the eye takes in a charming picture—a far-stretching valley enriched with orchards vineyards and cornfields through which the river traces a shining pathway across it appears the flat roofs and cathedral towers of the old mexican el paso still further dim misty mountains melt into the blue sky 35 during thecivil warconfederatemilitary forces were in the area until it was captured by the unioncalifornia columnin august 1862 it was then headquarters for the5th regiment california volunteer infantryfrom august 1863 until december 1864 36 after the civil wars conclusion the towns population began to grow as white texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority el paso itself incorporated in 1873 encompassed the small area of communities that had developed along the river in the 1870s a population of 23 non-hispanic whites and 150 hispanics was reported 37 with the arrival of thesouthern pacifictexas and pacific andatchison topeka and santa ferailroads in 1881 the population boomed to 10000 by the 1890 census with many anglo-americans recent immigrants old hispanic settlers and recent arrivals from mexico the location of el paso and the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wildboomtownknown as the six-shooter capital because of its lawlessness 34 indeed prostitution and gambling flourished until world war i when thedepartment of the armypressured el paso authorities to crack down on vice thus benefitting vice in neighboring ciudad juárez with the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the citys geographic position the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing transportation and retail center of the us southwest 37 ### 1900–present in 1909 theel paso chamber of commercehosted us presidentwilliam howard taftand mexican presidentporfirio díazat a planned summit in el paso texas and ciudad juárez mexico a historic first meeting between the presidents

creating a settled environment but this period was short-lived as themexican revolutiongreatly impacted the city bringing an influx of refugees—and capital—to the bustling boom town spanish-language newspapers theaters movie houses and schools were established many supported by a thriving mexican refugee middle class large numbers of clerics intellectuals and businessmen took refuge in the city particularly between 1913 and 1915 ultimately the violence of the mexican revolution followed the large mexican diaspora who had fled to el paso in 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917 various mexican revolutionary societies planned staged and launched violent attacks against both texans and their political mexican opponents in el paso this state of affairs eventually led to the vastplan de san diego which resulted in the murder of 21 american citizens 46 the subsequent reprisals by a local militia soon caused an escalation of violence wherein an estimated 300 mexicans and mexican-americans lost their lives these actions affected almost every resident of the entire rio grande valley resulting in millions of dollars of losses the result of the plan of san diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups 46 simultaneously other texans and americans gravitated to the city and by 1920 along with the us army troops the population exceeded 100000 and non-hispanic whites once again were in the clear majority nonetheless the city increased the segregation between mexicans and mexican-americans with non-hispanic whites one prominent form of segregation in the form of immigration controls to prevent disease allegedly was abused to createnonconsensualpornographicimages of women distributed in local bars 47 these rumors along with the perceived hazard fromkerosenebaths led to the1917 bath riots 48 as a result of the increased segregation the catholic church attempted to garner the mexican-american communitys allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations including the national catholic welfare fund 49 in 1916 the census bureau reported el pasos population as 53% mexican and 44% non-hispanic whites 50

expansion in the mid-1900s copper smeltingoilrefining and the proliferation of low-wage industries particularly garment making led to the citys growth additionally the departure of the regions rural population which was mostly non-hispanic white to cities like el paso brought a short-term burst of capital and labor but this was balanced by additional departures of middle-class americans to other parts of the country that offered new and better-paying jobs in turn local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap mexican labor furthermore the period from 1942 to 1956 had thebracero program which brought cheap mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the non-hispanic white population in turn seeking better-paying jobs these migrants also moved to el

across the region the sun shines 302 days per year on average in el paso 83% of daylight hours according to thenational weather service from this the city is nicknamed the sun city 85 due to its arid windy climate el paso often experiences sand and dust storms during the dry season particularly during the springtime between march and early may with an average wind speed often exceeding 30 mph 50 km h and gusts that have been measured at over 75 mph 120 km h these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert causing loss of visibility el paso and the nearby mountains also
