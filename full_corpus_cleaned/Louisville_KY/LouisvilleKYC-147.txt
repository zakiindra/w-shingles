kentucky 29 30 ### 19th century the citys early growth was influenced by the fact that river boats had to be unloaded and moved downriver before reaching the falls by 1828 the population had grown to 7000 and louisville became an incorporated city 31 early louisville was a major shipping port andenslaved african americansworked in a variety of associated trades 32 the city was often a point of escape forfugitive slavesto the north as indiana was a free state 32 33 during this point in the 1850s the city was growing and vibrant but that also came with negativity it was the center of planning supplies recruiting and transportation for numerous campaigns especially in thewestern theater ethnic tensions rose and on august 6 1855 known as bloody monday protestant mobs attacked german and

20th and 21st centuries following the civil war and the emancipation proclamation freed slaves settled in a neighborhood of louisville called little africa nicknamed the gateway to the south near the present neighborhood ofpark duvalle 41 the neighborhood was described as a thriving community by the 1920s and declined between the 1940s and 1950s 41 in 1914 the city of louisville passed a racially based residential zoning code following baltimore atlanta and a handful of cities in the carolinas 42 thenaacpchallenged the ordinance in two cases two weeks after the ordinance enacted an african-american named arthur harris moved into a house on a block designated for whites he was prosecuted and found guilty the second case was planned to create a test casewilliam warley the president of the local chapter of the naacp tendered a purchase offer on a white block from charles buchanan a white real estate agent warley also wrote a letter declaring his intention to build a house on that lot and reside there with the understanding that the louisville ordinance made it illegal for him to live there warley withheld payment setting in motion a breach of contract suit by buchanan 43 by 1917 the us supreme court agreed to hear the case ofbuchanan v warley the court struck down the louisville residential segregation ordinance ruling that it violated thefourteenth amendmentsdue processclause 44 in 1917 shortly after the united states entry intoworld war i louisville was selected as the site of camp zachary taylor camp taylor was one of the countrys largest world war i training camps it was home of the 84th infantry division and trained over 150000 men by the end of war includingf scott fitzgerald the camp was closed in 1921 many of the buildings and infrastructure in the camp taylor neighborhood of louisville are there as a result of the training camp in 1929 louisville completed thelock and damin thefalls of the ohioand the city began referring to itself as where northern enterprise andsouthern hospitalitymeet between the industrial boom of that year and through thegreat depression louisville gained 15000 new residents about 3% of them black most fleeing poverty in rural areas 45 throughout january 1937 19.17 inches 48.7 cm of rain fell in louisville and by january 27 the ohio river crested at a record 57.15 feet 17.42 m almost 30 feet 9.1 m above flood stage these events triggered thegreat flood of 1937 which lasted into early february thefloodsubmerged 60–70 percent of the city caused complete loss of power for four days and forced the evacuation of 175000 or 230000 residents depending on sources ninety people died as a result of the flood 46 47 it led to dramatic changes in where residents lived today the city is

reported louisvilles population as 84.3% white and 15.6% black 48 throughout the 1940s there were more blackpolice officersthan any other southern city though they were allowed to patrol only black districts this in part made louisville seem like a more racially progressive city than other southern cities although only when black citizens accepted a lower status than white citizens many historians have referred to this veil of segregation as apolite racism historian george wright stated that polite racism often deluded both blacks and well-meaning whites into believing that real progress was being made in their city for example in the cityjim crowpractices were not maintained by law so much as by custom 45 similar to many other older american cities louisville began to experience a movement of people and businesses to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s middle class residents used newly built freeways and interstate highways to commute to work moving into more distant but newer housing because of tax laws businesses found it cheaper to build new rather than renovate older buildings economic changes included a decline in local manufacturing the west end and older areas of the south end in particular began to decline economically as many local factories closed in 1974 a major f4 tornado hit louisville as part of the1974 super outbreakof tornadoes that
