salt lake city often shortened to salt lake or slc is the capital and most populous city of the us state of utah it is the county seat of salt lake county the most populous county in the state the population was 199723 at the 2020 census while the salt lake city metropolitan area has an estimated 1.3 million residents the 46th-largest metropolitan area in the united states it is also part of the larger salt lake city–ogden–provo combined statistical area an urban corridor along a 120-mile 190 km segment of the wasatch front with a population of approximately 2.8 million it is the principal urban center within the great basin along with reno nevada salt lake city was founded in 1847 by settlers led by brigham young who were seeking to escape persecution they had experienced while living farther east the mormon pioneers as they would come to be known entered a semi-arid valley and immediately began building an extensive irrigation network that could feed the population and foster future growth salt lake citys street grid system is based on a standard compass grid plan with the southeast corner of temple square serving as the origin of the salt lake meridian owing to its proximity to the great salt lake the city was originally named great salt lake city the word great was dropped from the citys name in 1868 immigration of international members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints lds church mining booms and the construction of the first transcontinental railroad brought economic growth and the city was nicknamed the crossroads of the west it was traversed by the lincoln highway the first transcontinental highway in 1913 two major cross-country freeways i-15 and i-80 now intersect in the city the city also has a belt route i-215 salt lake city has developed a strong tourist industry based primarily on skiing outdoor recreation and religious tourism it hosted the 2002 winter olympics and will host the 2034 winter olympics it is known for its politically liberal culture which stands in contrast with most of the rest of the states highly conservative leanings it is home to a significant lgbt community and hosts the annual utah pride festival it is the industrial banking center of the united states salt lake city and the surrounding area are also the location of several institutions of higher education including the states flagship research school the university of utah sustained drought in utah has strained salt lake citys water security caused the great salt lake level to drop to record low levels and has impacted the local and state economy the receding lake has exposed arsenic which may become airborne exposing area residents to poisonous dust the city is also under threat of major earthquake damage amplified by two offshoots of the nearby wasatch fault that join underneath the downtown area history before settlement by members of the lds church the shoshone weber ute and paiute had dwelt in the salt lake valley for thousands of years at the time of salt lake citys founding the valley was within the territory of the northwestern shoshone one local shoshone tribe the western goshute tribe had names for the jordan river city creek and red butte canyon pio-gwût soho-gwût and moni-wai-ni the goshutes or gosiutes also lived in the vicinity of salt lake and the valleys to the west the land was treated by the united states as public domain no aboriginal title by the northwestern shoshone was ever ceded or relinquished by treaty with the united states the first explorer of european descent in the salt lake area was likely jim bridger in 1825 although others had been in utah earlier including some who traveled as far north as the nearby utah valley the 1776 dominguez-escalante expedition were undoubtedly aware of salt lake valleys existence us army officer john c frémont surveyed the great salt lake and the salt lake valley in 1843 and 1845 the donner party a group of ill-fated pioneers had traveled through the great salt lake valley in august 1846 the settling of salt lake city dates to the arrival of the latter-day saints in july 1847 during the mexican-american war they had traveled beyond the boundaries of the united states into mexican territory seeking a secluded area to safely practice their religion away from the violence and the persecution they experienced in the united states upon arrival at the salt lake valley president of the church brigham young is recorded as stating this is the right place drive on brigham young is said to have seen the area in a vision before the wagon trains arrival they found the broad valley empty of any human settlement four days after arriving in the salt lake valley brigham young designated the building site for the salt lake temple the salt lake temple constructed on the block later called temple square took 40 years to complete construction started in 1853 and the temple was dedicated on april 6 1893 the temple has become an icon for the city and serves as its centerpiece the southeast corner of temple square is the point of reference for the salt lake meridian and for all addresses in the salt lake valley during the winter of 1847 an outbreak of measles killed many of the shoshone in the area the shoshone saved the pioneers when they taught them to eat the bulb of the native sego lily which has long been part of the ordinary diet of the shoshone sego being derived from the shoshone word seego the sego lily was commemorated by the sego lily dam a flood-prevention infrastructure project in the shape of a giant sego lily built in sugar house park in 2017 the city was not platted until after the federal surveyor abandoned his post in 1857 in 1855 congress directed the president of the united states to appoint a surveyor general for utah territory and to cause that the lands of that territory should be surveyed preparatory to bringing them on the market because of numerous conflicts between the surveyor and the territorial government the first surveyor general abandoned his post in 1857 not to return till 1869 the pioneers organized a state called state of deseret and petitioned for its recognition in 1849 the united states congress rebuffed the settlers in 1850 and established the utah territory vastly reducing its size and designated fillmore as its capital city great salt lake city replaced fillmore as the territorial capital in 1856 and the name later was shortened to salt lake city the citys population continued to swell with an influx of converts to the lds church and gold rush gold seekers making it one of the most populous cities in the american old west the first group of settlers brought african slaves with them making utah the only place in the western united states to have african slavery three slaves green flake hark lay and oscar crosby came west with the first group of settlers in 1847 the settlers also began to purchase indian slaves in the well-established indian slave trade as well as enslaving indian prisoners of war in 1850 26 slaves were counted in salt lake county in 1852 the territorial legislature passed the act in relation to service and the act for the relief of indian slaves and prisoners formally legalizing slavery in the territory on june 19 1862 during the american civil war congress prohibited slavery in all us territories explorer ethnologist and author richard francis burton traveled by coach in the summer of 1860 to document life in great salt lake city he was granted unprecedented access during his three-week visit including audiences with brigham young and other contemporaries of joseph smith the records of his visit include sketches of early city buildings a description of local geography and agriculture commentary on its politics and social order essays speeches and sermons from young isaac morley george washington bradley and other leaders and snippets of everyday life such as newspaper clippings and the menu from a high-society ball disputes with the federal government ensued over the churchs practice of polygamy a climax occurred in 1857 when president james buchanan declared the area in rebellion after brigham young refused to step down as governor beginning the utah war a division of the united states army commanded by albert sidney johnston later a general in the army of the confederate states of america marched through the city and found it had been evacuated they continued their march through the deserted city to vacant land at the southwest corner of the valley there they set up camp floyd 40 miles 64 km south of the city another military installation fort douglas was established in 1862 to maintain union allegiance during the american civil war many area leaders were incarcerated at the territorial prison in sugar house in the 1880s for violation of anti-polygamy laws the church began its eventual abandonment of polygamy in 1890 releasing the manifesto which officially suggested members obey the law of the land which was equivalent to forbidding new polygamous marriages inside the us and its territories but not in church member settlements in canada and mexico this paved the way for statehood in 1896 when salt lake city became the state capital the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869 at promontory summit on the north side of the great salt lake a railroad was connected to the city from the transcontinental railroad in 1870 making travel less burdensome mass migration of different groups followed ethnic chinese who had laid most of the central pacific railway established a flourishing chinatown in salt lake city nicknamed plum alley which housed around 1800 chinese during the early 20th century the chinese businesses and residences were demolished in 1952 although a historical marker has been erected near the parking ramp which has replaced plum alley immigrants also found economic opportunities in the booming mining industries remnants of a once-thriving japantown – namely a buddhist temple and japanese christian chapel – remain in downtown salt lake city european ethnic groups and east coast missionary groups constructed st marks episcopal cathedral in 1874 bnai israel temple in 1890 the roman catholic cathedral of the madeleine in 1909 and the greek orthodox holy trinity cathedral in 1923 this time period also saw the creation of salt lake citys now defunct red-light district that employed 300 courtesans at its height before being closed in 1911 during the late 19th and early 20th centuries an extensive streetcar system was constructed throughout the city with the first streetcar running in 1872 and electrification of the system in 1889 as in the rest of the country the automobile usurped the streetcar and the last trolley was approved for conversion in 1941 yet ran until 1945 due to world war ii trolley buses ran until 1946 light rail transit returned to the city when utas trax opened in 1999 the s line formerly known as sugar house streetcar opened for service in december 2013 on an old d&rgw right-of-way the citys population began to stagnate during the 20th century as population growth shifted to suburban areas north and south of the city few of these areas were annexed to the city while nearby towns incorporated and expanded as a result the population of the surrounding metropolitan area greatly outnumbers salt lake city a major concern of recent government officials has been combating inner-city commercial decay the city lost population from the 1960s through the 1980s but experienced some recovery in the 1990s presently the city has gained an estimated 5 percent of its population since the year 2000 the city has experienced significant demographic shifts in recent years hispanics now account for approximately 22% of residents and the city has a significant lgbt community there is also a large pacific islander population mainly samoans and tongans they compose roughly 2% of the population of the salt lake valley area salt lake city was selected in 1995 to host the 2002 winter olympics the games were plagued with controversy a bid scandal surfaced in 1998 alleging bribes had been offered to secure the bid during the games other scandals erupted over contested judging scores and illegal drug use despite the controversies the games were heralded as a financial success being one of the few in recent history to turn a profit in preparation major construction projects were initiated local freeways were expanded and repaired and a light rail system was constructed olympic venues are now used for local national and international sporting events and olympic athlete training however the predicted increase in businesses did not happen following the games on july 24 2024 salt lake city was formally chosen by the international olympic committee ioc to host the 2034 olympic winter games all of the facilities from the previous games can be re-used and the bid enjoyed support from the ioc and the city salt lake city hosted the 16th winter deaflympic games in 2007 taking place in the venues in salt lake city and park city and rotary international chose the city as the host site of their 2007 convention which was the single largest gathering in salt lake city since the 2002 winter olympics the us volleyball association convention in 2005 drew 39500 attendees in 2020 the city experienced a 5.7 magnitude earthquake protests against the killing of bernardo palacios-carbajal and a damaging windstorm with hurricane-force winds amidst the wider national george floyd protests the global covid-19 pandemic and protests against pandemic measures geography salt lake city has an area of 110.4 square miles 286 km2 and an average elevation of 4327 feet 1319 m above sea level the lowest point within the boundaries of the city is 4210 feet 1280 m near the jordan river and the great salt lake and the highest is grandview peak at 9410 feet 2868 m the city is in the northeast corner of the salt lake valley surrounded by the great salt lake to the northwest the steep wasatch range to the east and oquirrh mountains to the west its encircling mountains contain several narrow canyons including city creek emigration millcreek and parleys which border the eastern city limits the burgeoning population of salt lake city and the surrounding metropolitan area combined with its geographical situation has led to air quality becoming a concern the great basin is subject to strong temperature inversions during the winter which trap pollutants and decrease the air quality the utah division of air quality monitors air quality and issues alerts for voluntary and mandatory actions when pollution exceeds federal safety standards protests have been held at the utah state capitol and democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation in the utah state legislature to make public transportation free during january and july when air quality is usually at its worst the population of the salt lake city metropolitan area is projected to double by 2040 putting further pressure on the regions air quality the great salt lake is separated from salt lake city by extensive marshlands and mudflats the metabolic activities of bacteria in the lake result in a phenomenon known as lake stink a scent reminiscent of foul poultry eggs two to three times per year for a few hours the jordan river flows through the city and is a drainage of utah lake that empties into the great salt lake the highest mountaintop visible from salt lake city is twin peaks which reaches 11330 feet 3450 m twin peaks is southeast of salt lake city in the wasatch range the second-highest mountain range is the oquirrhs reaching a maximum height of 10620 feet 3237 m at flat top the east–west-oriented traverse mountains to the south extend to 6000 1830m nearly connecting the wasatch and oquirrh mountains the mountains near salt lake city are easily visible from the city and have sharp vertical relief caused by ancient earthquakes with a maximum difference of 7099 feet 2164 m being achieved with the rise of twin peaks from the salt lake valley floor the salt lake valley floor is the ancient lakebed of lake bonneville which existed at the end of the last ice age several lake bonneville shorelines can be distinctly seen as terraces on the foothills or benches of nearby mountains ancient folds of lake bonneville shorelines also lie underneath salt lake city amplifying the danger of earthquakes earthquake faults salt lake city is subject to earthquakes from active fault lines running through it these faults are related to the regional wasatch fault which runs north–south along the western base of the wasatch range and is considered at high risk of producing an earthquake as large as 7.5 magnitude catastrophic damage is predicted in the event of an earthquake with major damage resulting from the liquefaction of the clay- and sand-based soil and the possible permanent flooding of portions of the city by the great salt lake on march 18 2020 a 5.7 magnitude earthquake the largest in the salt lake city area in modern times hit magna just southwest of salt lake city causing some minor damage throughout the valley damage in salt lake city was especially evident in historic brick homes—unreinforced masonry buildings—such as the 1892 sears mansion which required demolition after the earthquake the warm springs fault and the east bench fault offshoots of the wasatch fault were found in 2021 to connect underneath salt lake city increasing the risk of major metropolitan damage from an earthquake prior to this in 1997 the salt lake tribune published a front-page exposé about how the construction of the downtown salt palace convention center had been hastened by the county geologist who erased the warm springs fault from earthquake maps of salt lake city so that the downtown area appeared to be free of faults enabling the convention center developers to avoid the time and expense of an earthquake hazard and risk assessment the newspaper showed that the warm springs fault runs north–south along w temple directly adjacent to temple square and the convention center a year later a fault segment was found at the southern edge of the convention center and expansion plans were halted until more earthquake fault studies could be completed layout the city as well as the county is laid out on a grid plan most major streets run very north–south and east–west the grids origin is the southeast corner of temple square the block containing the salt lake temple the north–south axis is main street and the east–west axis is south temple street addresses are coordinates within the system similar to latitude and longitude odd and even address numbering depends on the quadrant of the grid in which an address is located the rule is when traveling away from the grid center temple square or its axes main street south temple street odd numbers will be on the left side of the street a common explanation for the unusually wide streets of salt lake city is that brigham young wanted a wagon with a team of oxen to be able to turn around however young was never recorded giving this directive joseph smith founder of the latter day saint movement planned the layout in the plat of the city of zion intended as a template for mormon towns wherever they might be built this plan included streets 132 ft 40 m wide and may be the source of the unusual width these wide streets and grid pattern are typical of other mormon towns of the pioneer era throughout the west though the nomenclature may initially confuse new arrivals and visitors most consider the grid system an aid to navigation some streets have names such as state street which would otherwise be known as 100 east other streets have honorary names such as the western portion of 300 south named adam galvez street for a local marine corporal killed in action or others honoring rosa parks martin luther king jr césar chávez harvey milk and john stockton these honorary names appear only on street signs and cannot be used in postal addresses in the avenues neighborhood north–south streets are given letters of the alphabet and east–west streets are numbered in 2.5-acre 1.0 ha blocks smaller than those in the rest of the city smiths plat of zion specified the city was to be developed into 135 10-acre 4.0 ha lots however the blocks in salt lake city became irregular during the late 19th century when the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints lost authority over growth and before the adoption of zoning ordinances in the 1920s the original 10-acre 4.0 ha blocks allowed for large garden plots and many were supplied with irrigation water from ditches that ran approximately where modern curbs and gutters would be laid the original water supply was from city creek subsequent development of water resources was from successively more southern streams flowing from the mountains east of the city some old irrigation ditches are still visible in the eastern suburbs or are still marked on maps years after they were gone there are still some canals that deliver water as required by water rights many lots in salt lake city and surrounding areas have irrigation water rights attached to them local water systems in particular salt lake city public utilities have a tendency to acquire or trade for these water rights these can then be traded for culinary water rights to water imported into the valley at its peak irrigation in the valley comprised over one hundred distinct canal systems many originating at the jordan narrows at the south end of the valley water and water rights were important in the 19th and early 20th centuries as heavy agricultural usage changed into a more urban and suburban pattern canal water companies were gradually replaced by culinary water systems cityscape downtown salt lake city has been a hub of commerce for the intermountain west and its architecture reflects this history main street which was the primary commercial avenue for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries anchors the historic core of the downtown area that begins at the salt lake temple and concludes at the city and county building halfway between those two structures the walker center at the corner of main and 200 south was built in 1912 and was the tallest building between chicago and san francisco upon its completion other extant pre-war structures include the kearns building hotel monaco the first security building the joseph smith memorial building formerly hotel utah the boston and newhouse buildings the utah state capitol and the clift building salt lake city has two historic passenger rail depots the denver and rio grande western depot and the union pacific depot the latter of which now anchors the gateway district salt lake city lost many significant structures to forces such as urban renewal in the 20th century including the dooly building designed by louis sullivan the hotel newhouse and the salt lake theatre after a period of stagnation in the era of urban sprawl and with the construction of trax in the late 1990s and the city creek center in the early 2010s downtown salt lake city is experiencing a period of revival empty lots and older structures are in the process of being redeveloped into apartment and office towers and the city has begun to close main street to automobile traffic on summer weekends to encourage pedestrian activity and business more than 5000 new residential units are planned or under construction for the downtown area as of april 2021 and many new breweries and restaurants have opened in the last decade regent street which in the early 20th century was the citys red-light district has recently been redeveloped with the notable additions of the 2468-seat eccles theater and 111 main an adjacent 24-story office building a distinctive feature of salt lake citys cityscape is its very large block sizes which are 660 feet square and separated by streets 132 feet wide making them the largest in the united states this and the resulting development patterns gives the city and its buildings a unique sense of scale but also a distinct challenge to urban walkability with many streets boasting six lanes for automobile traffic on the other hand the extra-wide streets have made the addition of dedicated transit lanes and light rail more feasible and many streets are now being redesigned with features such as protected bike lanes linear parks and even spaces for urban development within the medians the city also encourages new projects to incorporate mid-block walkways and other scale-mitigation strategies into planning to promote pedestrian engagement neighborhoods salt lake city has many distinct neighborhoods there is a general east–west socioeconomic divide the eastern neighborhoods of the city such as the avenues 9th & 9th yalecrest federal heights and sugar house tend to be more affluent these districts are popular with professionals families and students due to their proximity to downtown the university of utah commercial precincts and the wasatch foothills the western neighborhoods of the city such as poplar grove rose park and glendale tend to be more working-class and ethnically diverse and are popular with immigrants and young people this divide is a result of the railroad being built in the western half as well as panoramic views from inclined ground in the eastern portion housing is more economically diverse on the west side which results in demographic differences interstate 15 was also built in a north–south line further dividing east and west sides of the city sugar house in southeastern salt lake city has a reputation as an older neighborhood with small shops in the center sugar house is an area which has been the focus of redevelopment efforts such as the uta s-line streetcar in late 2015 there were approximately 900 apartment units either recently built or under construction in the sugar house area with an additional 492 units proposed northeast of downtown is the avenues a neighborhood outside of the regular grid system on smaller blocks the area between 6th avenue to south temple street is a historical district that is nearly entirely residential and contains many historical victorian era homes recently the avenues is becoming known for restaurants and shops opening in old retail space mixed within the community the avenues are situated on the upward-sloping bench in the foothills of the wasatch range with the earlier built homes in the lower elevation the avenues along with federal heights just to the east and north of the university of utah and the foothill area south of the university contain gated communities large multimillion-dollar houses and panoramic views of the valley many consider this some of the most desirable real estate in the valley in addition to larger centers like sugar house and downtown salt lake city contains several smaller neighborhoods each named after the closest major intersection two examples are the 9th and 9th at the intersection of 900 east and 900 south streets and 15th & 15th at the intersection of 1500 east and 1500 south streets neighborhoods these areas are home to foot-traffic friendly amenities-based businesses such as art galleries clothing retail salons restaurants and coffee shops during the summer of 2007 9th and 9th saw sidewalk and street improvements as well as an art installation by troy pillow of seattle washington inspired by the 9 muses of greek myth thanks in part to a monetary grant from salt lake city many of the homes in the valley date from pre–world war ii times and only a select few areas such as federal heights and the east bench as well as the far west side including parts of rose park and glendale have seen new home construction since the 1970s climate salt lake city has a humid continental climate dsa while western parts may experience a mediterranean climate csa as summers are dry and hot and winters are cold and wet but rarely frigid the eastern parts of the city are also under a mediterranean climate when using the 27 °f −3 °c isotherm late summer and early fall monsoonal activity can keep precipitation fairly consistent throughout the year aside from early to mid summer when rain is minimal the temperature of the salt lake city area is mediated by its unique geography generally keeping highs and lows from reaching extremes the primary source of precipitation in salt lake city is massive storms that move in from the pacific ocean along the jet stream from october to may in mid-to-late summer when the jet stream retreats far to the north precipitation mainly comes from afternoon thunderstorms caused by monsoon moisture moving up from the gulf of california although rainfall can be heavy these storms are usually scattered in coverage and rarely severe however downtown was hit by an f2 tornado on august 11 1999 killing 1 person injuring 60 and causing $170 million in damage the remnants of tropical cyclones from the east pacific can rarely reach the city during fall the remnants of hurricane olivia helped bring the record monthly precipitation of 7.04 inches 179 mm in september 1982 1983 was the wettest year on record with 24.26 inches 616 mm while 1979 was the driest when 8.70 inches 221 mm were recorded spring snowmelt from the surrounding mountains can cause localized stream flooding during late spring and early summer the worst examples being in 1952 and especially 1983 when city creek burst its banks forcing city engineers to convert several downtown streets into waterways snow falls on average from november 6 to april 18 producing a total average of 60 inches 152 cm although measurable snow has fallen as early as september 17 and as late as may 28 the snowiest season was 1951–52 with 117.3 inches 298 cm while the least snowy season was 16.6 inches 42 cm in 1933–34 the snowiest month on record was january 1993 in which 50.3 inches 128 cm were recorded the nearby great salt lake is a significant contributor to precipitation in the city the lake effect can enhance rain from summer thunderstorms and produces lake-effect snow approximately 6 to 8 times per year some of which can produce prodigious snowfall amounts it is estimated about 10% of the annual precipitation in the city can be attributed to the lake effect salt lake city features large variations in temperatures between seasons during summer there are an average of 56 days per year with temperatures of at least 90 °f 32.2 °c 23 days of at least 95 °f 35 °c and 9 days of 100 °f 37.8 °c however average daytime july humidity is only 22% winters are quite cold but rarely frigid while an average of 127 days drop to or below freezing and 26 days with high temperatures that fail to rise above freezing the city only averages 6.3 days at or below 10 °f −12.2 °c the record high temperature is 107 °f 42 °c which occurred first on july 26 1960 july 13 2002 june 16 2021 july 17 2022 and most recently september 7 2022 while the record low is −30 °f −34 °c which occurred on february 9 1933 during mid-winter strong areas of high pressure often stagnate over the great basin leading to strong temperature inversions this causes air stagnation and thick smog in the valley from several days to weeks at a time and can result in the nations worst air-pollution levels this same effect will also occasionally play a role in the summer months causing tropospheric ozone to peak in july & august but in 2015 it started at the beginning of june in 2016 salt lakes air quality was ranked 6th worst in the nation by the american lung association it received an f grade for both ozone and particulate matter particulate pollution is considered especially dangerous as the tiny pollutants can lodge deep in lung tissue both ozone and particulate pollution are associated with increased rates of strokes heart attacks respiratory disease cancer and premature death outdoor air particulates have been associated with low and very low birth weight premature birth congenital defects and death severe drought and water diversions have shrunk the great salt lake by two-thirds and reduced it to its lowest recorded levels resulting in hundreds of square miles of dry lake bed and exposing millions of people living in the fast-growing metropolitan region to dust storms laced with arsenic and other toxic chemicals around 65% of the diverted water goes to agriculture but demand for water is soaring as utahs population grows parks the largest park in salt lake city is this is the place heritage park a part of the utah state parks system at 217.5 acres this is the place heritage park re-creates typical 19th-century pioneer life and contains over 50 restored or replicated historical buildings this is the place monument also is located within the park marking the end of the mormon trail sugar house park is the second largest park in salt lake city at 110 acres 45 ha and is a part of the salt lake county park system the park is known for its large rolling hills surrounding a 4.5 acres 1.8 ha pond with

oft-delayed freeway opened september 2008 heading north from i-215 into davis county along the east shore of the great salt lake travel to and from davis county is complicated by geography as roads have to squeeze through the narrow opening between the great salt lake to the west and the wasatch mountains to the east only four roads run between the two counties to carry the load of rush hour traffic from davis county salt lake citys surface street system is laid out on a simple grid pattern road names are numbered with a north south east or west designation with the grid originating at the southeast corner of temple square downtown one of the visions of brigham young and the early settlers was to create wide spacious streets which characterizes downtown the grid pattern remains fairly intact in the city except on the east bench where geography makes it impossible the entire salt lake valley is laid out on the same numbered grid system although it becomes increasingly irregular further into the suburbs many streets carry both a name and a grid coordinate usually both can be used as an address us-89 enters the city from the northwest becomes 900 west street through
