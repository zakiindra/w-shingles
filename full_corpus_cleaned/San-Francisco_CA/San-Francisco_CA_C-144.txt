spanish exploration party arrived on november 2 1769 the first documented european visit to san francisco bay the ohlone name for san francisco was ahwaste meaning place at the bay the arrival of spanish colonists and the implementation of their mission system marked the beginning of the assimilation of the ramaytush people and the decline of their language and culture spanish era the spanish empire claimed san francisco as part of las californias a province of the viceroyalty of new spain the spanish first arrived in what is now san francisco on november 2 1769 when the portolá expedition led by don gaspar de portolá and juan crespí arrived at san francisco bay having noted the strategic benefits of the area due to its large natural harbor the spanish dispatched pedro fages in 1770 to find a more direct route to the san francisco peninsula from monterey which would become part of the el camino real route by 1774 juan bautista de anza had arrived to the area to select the sites for a mission and presidio the first european maritime presence in san francisco bay occurred on august 5 1775 when the spanish ship san carlos commanded by juan manuel de ayala became the first ship to anchor in the bay soon after on march 28 1776 anza established the presidio of san francisco on october 9 mission san francisco de asís also known as mission dolores was founded by padre francisco palóu in 1794 the presidio established the castillo de san joaquín a fortification on the southern side of the golden gate which later came to be known as fort point in 1804 the province of alta california was created which included san francisco at its peak in 1810–1820 the average population at the mission dolores settlement was about 1100 people mexican era in 1821 the californias were ceded to mexico by spain the extensive california mission system gradually lost its influence during the period of mexican rule although it was not until 1833 that the missions would be secularized agricultural land became largely privatized as ranchos as was occurring in other parts of california coastal trade increased including a half-dozen barques from various atlantic ports which regularly sailed in california waters with the enactment of the mexican secularization act of 1833 the missions were made to divest themselves of their extensive landholdings and emancipate the indigenous people under their control as part of the process of secularization governor josé figueroa opened up san francisco to civilian settlement prior to secularization the only settlements in san francisco had been the military settlement at the presidio and the religious settlement at mission dolores in 1835 the presidio garrison commanded by mariano vallejo relocated to the presidio of sonoma which was regarded as needing a greater military presence due the proximity of the russian settlement at fort ross only a small detachment remained at the presidio of san francisco mission dolores sold most of its property in 1836 retaining only the church and related structures in 1833 juana briones de miranda was granted a small rancho at el polín spring near the presidio founding the first non-indigenous civilian household in san francisco in 1834 the pueblo of yerba buena was founded yerba buena cove named after a native herb was already a favored anchorage spot and the new settlement and trading post was founded by its shores yerba buena was located in what is now the citys chinatown and financial district and was centered on a plaza that is now portsmouth square a land survey of yerba buena was made by the swiss immigrant jean jacques vioget as prelude to the city plan francisco de haro became the first alcalde of yerba buena in 1835 the second alcalde josé joaquín estudillo approved the first land grant in yerba buena to william richardson yerba buena began to attract american and european settlers an 1842 census listed 21 residents 11% born in the united states or europe as well as one filipino merchant following the bear flag revolt in sonoma and the beginning of the us conquest of california american forces from the uss portsmouth under the command of john b montgomery captured yerba buena on july 9 1846 with little resistance from the local californio population raising the american flag over yerba buena plaza later renamed portsmouth square in commemoration of this event following the capture us forces appointed both josé de jesús noé and washington allon bartlett to serve as co- alcaldes mayors while the conquest continued on in the rest of california on january 30 1847 mayor bartlett ordained that the city should officially change its name from yerba buena to san francisco as the former name was only locally recognized and the latter name was in use on international maps there was also concern that a new town being planned by general vallejo on the carquinez strait was to be called francisca after the first name of his wife after the name change to san francisco the name of vallejos town was changed to benicia after his wifes middle name following the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo in 1848 alta california was ceded from mexico to the united states post-conquest era despite its attractive location as a port and naval base post-conquest san francisco was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography situated at the tip of a windswept peninsula without water or firewood san francisco lacked most of the basic facilities for a 19th-century settlement citation needed its 1847 population was said to be 459 the california gold rush brought a flood of treasure seekers prospectors accumulated in san francisco over rival benicia raising the population from 1000 in 1848 to 25000 by december 1849 the promise of wealth was so strong that crews on arriving vessels deserted and rushed off to the gold fields leaving behind a forest of masts in san francisco harbor some of these approximately 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships saloons and hotels many were left to rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot by 1851 the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships by 1870 yerba buena cove had been filled to create new land buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings california was quickly granted statehood in 1850 and the us military built fort point at the golden gate and a fort on alcatraz island to secure san francisco bay san francisco county was one of the states 18 original counties established at california statehood in 1850 until 1856 san franciscos city limits extended west to divisadero street and castro street and south to 20th street in 1856 the california state government divided the county a straight line was then drawn across the tip of the san francisco peninsula just north of san bruno mountain everything south of the line became the new san mateo county while everything north of the line became the new consolidated city and county of san francisco the california gold rush triggered a wave of entrepreneurial activity as individuals sought to capitalize on the newfound wealth the discovery of silver deposits notably the comstock lode in nevada in 1859 further fueled rapid population growth and economic expansion san francisco as the gateway to the goldfields experienced a surge in population and commercial activity however the influx of fortune seekers also brought challenges lawlessness was rampant and the barbary coast district became synonymous with vice attracting criminals prostitutes and illicit activities including but not limited to prostitution bootlegging and gambling the rapidly growing population with its lawlessness gambling and other vices and the fact that there were no churches to be found prompted missionaries like william taylor to come to san francisco where he began preaching in the streets using an upright barrel as his pulpit taylor garnered enough generous donations from successful gold miners to build a church one of the most influential figures of this era was william chapman ralston a shrewd banker and investor ralston amassed considerable wealth and influence in san francisco he gained control over a significant portion of the comstock lode s gold and silver mines establishing a virtual monopoly using his incredible clout ralston was able to generate millions of dollars for san francisco during its heady boom years he founded the bank of california the first bank in the western united states and built the opulent palace hotel a symbol of san franciscos newfound prosperity and the largest hotel in the country at the time his financial empire however collapsed in 1875 as a result of the panic of 1873 triggering a major economic crisis in san francisco development of the port of san francisco and the establishment in 1869 of overland access to the eastern us rail system via the newly completed pacific railroad the construction of which the city only reluctantly helped support helped make the bay area a center for trade catering to the needs and tastes of the growing population levi strauss opened a dry goods business and domingo ghirardelli began manufacturing chocolate chinese immigrants made the city a polyglot culture drawn to old gold mountain creating the citys chinatown quarter by 1880 chinese made up 9.3% of the population the first cable cars carried san franciscans up clay street in 1873 the citys sea of victorian houses began to take shape and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park resulting in plans for golden gate park san franciscans built schools churches theaters and all the hallmarks of civic life the presidio developed into the most important american military installation on the pacific coast by 1890 san franciscos population approached 300000 making it the eighth-largest city in the united states at the time around 1901 san francisco was a major city known for its flamboyant style stately hotels ostentatious mansions on nob hill and a thriving arts scene the first north american plague epidemic was the san francisco plague of 1900–1904 1906 earthquake and interwar era at 512 am on april 18 1906 a major earthquake struck san francisco and northern california as buildings collapsed from the shaking ruptured gas lines ignited fires that spread across the city and burned out of control for several days with water mains out of service the presidio artillery corps attempted to contain the inferno by dynamiting blocks of buildings to create firebreaks more than three-quarters of the city lay in ruins including almost all of the downtown core contemporary accounts reported that 498 people died though modern estimates put the number in the several thousands more than half of the citys population of 400000 was left homeless refugees settled temporarily in makeshift tent villages in golden gate park the presidio on the beaches and elsewhere many fled permanently to the east bay jack london is remembered for having famously eulogized the earthquake not in history has a modern imperial city been so completely destroyed san francisco is gone rebuilding was rapid and performed on a grand scale rejecting calls to completely remake the street grid san franciscans opted for speed amadeo giannini s bank of italy later to become bank of america provided loans for many of those whose livelihoods had been devastated the influential san francisco planning and urban research association or spur was founded in 1910 to address the quality of housing after the earthquake the earthquake hastened development of western neighborhoods that survived the fire including pacific heights where many of the citys wealthy rebuilt their homes in turn the destroyed mansions of nob hill became grand hotels city hall rose again in the beaux arts style and the city celebrated its rebirth at the panama–pacific international exposition in 1915 during this period san francisco built some of its most important infrastructure civil engineer michael oshaughnessy was hired by san francisco mayor james rolph as chief engineer for the city in september 1912 to supervise the construction of the twin peaks reservoir the stockton street tunnel the twin peaks tunnel the san francisco municipal railway the auxiliary water supply system and new sewers san franciscos streetcar system was pushed to completion by oshaughnessy between 1915 and 1927 it was the oshaughnessy dam hetch hetchy reservoir and hetch hetchy aqueduct that would have the largest effect on san francisco an abundant water supply enabled san francisco to develop into the city it has become today in ensuing years the city solidified its standing as a financial capital in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash not a single san francisco-based bank failed indeed it was at the height of the great depression that san francisco undertook two great civil engineering projects simultaneously constructing the san francisco–oakland bay bridge and the golden gate bridge completing them in 1936 and 1937 respectively it was in this period that the island of alcatraz a former military stockade began its service as a federal maximum security prison housing notorious inmates such as al capone and robert franklin stroud the birdman of alcatraz san francisco later celebrated its regained grandeur with a worlds fair the golden gate international exposition in 1939–40 creating treasure island in the middle of the bay to house it contemporary era during world war ii the city-owned sharp park in pacifica was used as an internment camp to detain japanese americans hunters point naval shipyard became a hub of activity and fort mason became the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the pacific theater of operations the explosion of jobs drew many people especially african americans from the south to the area after the end of the war many military personnel returning from service abroad and civilians who had originally come to work decided to stay the united nations charter creating the united nations was drafted and signed in san francisco in 1945 and in 1951 the treaty of san francisco re-established peaceful relations between japan and the allied powers urban planning projects in the 1950s and 1960s involved widespread destruction and redevelopment of west-side neighborhoods and the construction of new freeways of which only a series of short segments were built before being halted by citizen-led opposition the onset of containerization made san franciscos small piers obsolete and cargo activity moved to the larger port of oakland the city began to lose industrial jobs and turned to tourism as the most important segment of its economy the suburbs experienced rapid growth and san francisco underwent significant demographic change as large segments of the white population left the city supplanted by an increasing wave of immigration from asia and latin america from 1950 to 1980 the city lost over 10 percent of its population over this period san francisco became a magnet for americas counterculture movement beat generation writers fueled the san francisco renaissance and centered on the north beach neighborhood in the 1950s hippies flocked to haight-ashbury in the 1960s reaching a peak with the 1967 summer of love in 1974 the zebra murders left at least 16 people dead in the 1970s the city became a center of the gay rights movement with the emergence of the castro as an urban gay village the election of harvey milk to the board of supervisors and his assassination along with that of mayor george moscone in 1978 bank of america now based in charlotte north carolina was founded in san francisco the bank completed 555 california street in 1969 the transamerica pyramid was completed in 1972 igniting a wave of manhattanization that lasted until the late 1980s a period of extensive high-rise development downtown the 1980s also saw a dramatic increase in the number of homeless people in the city an issue that remains today despite many attempts to address it the 1989 loma prieta earthquake caused destruction and loss of life throughout the bay area in san francisco the quake severely damaged structures in the marina and south of market districts and precipitated the demolition of the damaged embarcadero freeway and much of the damaged central freeway allowing the city to reclaim the embarcadero as its historic downtown waterfront and revitalizing the hayes valley neighborhood the three recent decades have seen booms driven by the internet industry during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s startup companies invigorated the san francisco economy large numbers of entrepreneurs and computer application developers moved into the city followed by marketing design and sales professionals changing the social landscape as once poorer neighborhoods became increasingly gentrified demand for new housing and office space ignited a second wave of high-rise development this time in the south of market district by 2000 the citys population reached new highs surpassing the previous record set in 1950 when the bubble burst in 2001 many of these companies folded and their employees were laid off yet high technology and entrepreneurship remain mainstays of the san francisco economy by the mid-2000s decade the social media boom had begun with san francisco becoming a popular location for tech offices and a common place to live for people employed in silicon valley companies such as apple and google the early 2020s saw a reduction of tech companies presence in downtown san francisco in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic increased popularity of working at home and struggles with homelessness although some observers have raised the possibility that office vacancies and declining tax revenues could cause san francisco to enter an economic doom loop other sources have refuted this broad-based characterization of the city as a whole asserting that the issues of concern are restricted primarily to the urban core of san francisco as of march 2024 union square was in sorry shape and had lost its traditional position as the bay areas regional shopping hub to westfield valley fair in san jose the ferry station post office building armour & co building atherton house and ymca hotel are historic buildings among dozens of historical landmarks in the city according to

portions of alameda island red rock island and angel island —are part of the city also included are the uninhabited farallon islands 27 miles 43 km offshore in the pacific ocean the mainland within the city limits roughly forms a seven-by-seven-mile square a common local colloquialism referring to the citys shape though its total area including water is nearly 232 square miles 600 km 2 there are more than 50 hills within the city limits some neighborhoods are named after the hill on which they are situated including nob hill potrero hill and russian hill near the geographic center of the city

1811 ft 552 m above sea level the nearby san andreas and hayward faults are responsible for much earthquake activity although neither physically passes through the city itself the san andreas fault caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989 minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis the threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the citys infrastructure development the city constructed an auxiliary water supply system and has repeatedly upgraded its building codes requiring retrofits for older buildings and higher engineering standards for new construction however there are still thousands of smaller buildings that remain vulnerable to quake damage usgs has released the california earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in california san franciscos shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits entire neighborhoods such as the marina mission bay and hunters point as well as large sections of the embarcadero sit on areas of landfill treasure island was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from the excavation of the yerba buena tunnel through yerba buena island during the construction of the bay bridge such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes the resulting soil liquefaction causes extensive damage to property built upon it as was evidenced in the marina district during the 1989 loma prieta earthquake a few natural lakes and creeks lake merced mountain lake pine lake lobos creek el polin spring are within parks and remain protected in what is essentially their original form but most of the citys natural watercourses such as islais creek and mission creek have been partially or completely culverted and built over since the 1990s however the public utilities commission has been studying proposals to daylight or restore some creeks neighborhoods an historical center of san francisco monument where the 1899–1906 city hall was once located is in united nations plaza at
