derived from a french rendering of the indigenous miami–illinois word shikaakwa for a wild relative of the onion it is known to botanists as allium tricoccum and known more commonly as ramps the first known reference to the site of the current city of chicago as checagou was by robert de lasalle around 1679 in a memoir 20 henri joutel in his journal of 1688 noted that the eponymous wild garlic grew profusely in the area 21 according to his diary of late september 1687 when we arrived at the said place called chicagou which according to what we were able to learn of it has taken this name because of the quantity of garlic which grows in the forests in this region 21 the city has had several nicknames throughout its history such as the windy city chi-town second city and city of the big shoulders 22 ## history ## beginnings in the mid-18th century the area was inhabited by the potawatomi an indigenous tribe who had succeeded the miami sauk and meskwaki peoples in this region 23 the first known permanent settler in chicago was trader jean baptiste point du sable du sable was of african descent perhaps born in the french colony of saint-domingue haiti and established the settlement in the 1780s he is commonly known as the founder of chicago 24 25 26 in 1795 following the victory of the new united states in the northwest indian war an area that was to be part of chicago was turned over to the us for a military post by native tribes in accordance with the treaty of greenville in 1803 the us army constructed fort dearborn which was destroyed during the war of 1812 in the battle of fort dearborn by the potawatomi before being later rebuilt 27 after the war of 1812 the ottawa ojibwe and potawatomi tribes ceded additional land to the united states in the 1816 treaty of st louis the potawatomi were forcibly removed from their land after the 1833 treaty of chicago and sent west of the mississippi river as part of the federal policy of indian removal 28 29 30 ## 19th century on august 12 1833 the town of chicago was organized with a population of about 200 30 within seven years it grew to more than 6000 people on june 15 1835 the first public land sales began with edmund dick taylor as receiver of public monies the city of chicago was incorporated on saturday march 4 1837 31 and for several decades was the worlds fastest-growing city 32 as the site of the chicago portage 33 the city became an important transportation hub between the eastern and western united states chicagos first railway galena and chicago union railroad and the illinois and michigan canal opened in 1848 the canal allowed steamboats and sailing ships on the great lakes to connect to the mississippi river 34 35 36 37 a flourishing economy brought residents from rural communities and immigrants from abroad manufacturing and retail and finance sectors became dominant influencing the american economy 38 the chicago board of trade established 1848 listed the first-ever standardized exchange-traded forward contracts which were called futures contracts 39 in the 1850s chicago gained national political prominence as the home of senator stephen douglas the champion of the kansas–nebraska act and the popular sovereignty approach to the issue of the spread of slavery 40 these issues also helped propel another illinoisan abraham lincoln to the national stage lincoln was nominated in chicago for us president at the 1860 republican national convention which was held in a purpose-built auditorium called the wigwam he defeated douglas in the general election and this set the stage for the american civil war to accommodate rapid population growth and demand for better sanitation the city improved its infrastructure in february 1856 chicagos common council approved chesbrough s plan to build the united states first comprehensive sewerage system 41 the project raised much of central chicago to a new grade with the use of jackscrews for raising buildings 42 while elevating chicago and at first improving the citys health the untreated sewage and industrial waste now flowed into the chicago river and subsequently into lake michigan polluting the citys primary freshwater source the city responded by tunneling two miles 3.2 km out into lake michigan to newly built water cribs in 1900 the problem of sewage contamination was largely resolved when the city completed a major engineering feat it reversed the flow of the chicago river so that the water flowed away from lake michigan rather than into it this project began with the construction and improvement of the illinois and michigan canal and was completed with the chicago sanitary and ship canal that connects to the illinois river which flows into the mississippi river 43 44 45 in 1871 the great chicago fire destroyed an area about 4 miles 6.4 km long and 1-mile 1.6 km wide a large section of the city at the time 46 47 48 much of the city including railroads and stockyards survived intact 49 and from the ruins of the previous wooden structures arose more modern constructions of steel and stone these set a precedent for worldwide construction 50 51 during its rebuilding period chicago constructed the worlds first skyscraper in 1885 using steel-skeleton construction 52 53 the city grew significantly in size and population by incorporating many neighboring townships between 1851 and 1920 with the largest annexation happening in 1889 with five townships joining the city including the hyde park township which now comprises most of the south side of chicago and the far southeast of chicago and the jefferson township which now makes up most of chicagos northwest side 54 the desire to join the city was driven by municipal services that the city could provide its residents chicagos flourishing economy attracted huge numbers of new immigrants from europe and migrants from the eastern united states of the total population in 1900 more than 77% were either foreign-born or born in the united states of foreign parentage germans irish poles swedes and czechs made up nearly two-thirds of the foreign-born population by 1900 whites were 98.1% of the citys population 55 56 labor conflicts followed the industrial boom and the rapid expansion of the labor pool including the haymarket affair on may 4 1886 and in 1894 the pullman strike anarchist and socialist groups played prominent roles in creating very large and highly organized labor actions concern for social problems among chicagos immigrant poor led jane addams and ellen gates starr to found hull house in 1889 57 programs that were developed there became a model for the new field of social work 58 during the 1870s and 1880s chicago attained national stature as the leader in the movement to improve public health city laws and later state laws that upgraded standards for the medical profession and fought urban epidemics of cholera smallpox and yellow fever were both passed and enforced these laws became templates for public health reform in other cities and states 59 the city established many large well-landscaped municipal parks which also included public sanitation facilities the chief advocate for improving public health in chicago was john h rauch md rauch established a plan for chicagos park system in 1866 he created lincoln park by closing a cemetery filled with shallow graves and in 1867 in response to an outbreak of cholera he helped establish a new chicago board of health ten years later he became the secretary and then the president of the first illinois state board of health which carried out most of its activities in chicago 60 in the 1800s chicago became the nations railroad hub and by 1910 over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals 61 62 in 1883 chicagos railway managers needed a general time convention so they developed the standardized system of north american time zones 63 this system for telling time spread throughout the continent in 1893 chicago hosted the worlds columbian exposition on former marshland at the present location of jackson park the exposition drew 27.5 million visitors and is considered the most influential worlds fair in history 64 65 the university of chicago formerly at another location moved to the same south side location in 1892 the term midway for a fair or carnival referred originally to the midway plaisance a strip of park land that still runs through the university of chicago campus and connects the washington and jackson parks 66 67 ## 20th and 21st centuries during world war i and the 1920s there was a major expansion in industry the availability of jobs attracted african americans from the southern united states between 1910 and 1930 the african american population of chicago increased dramatically from 44103 to 233903 68 this great migration had an immense cultural impact called the chicago black renaissance part of the new negro movement in art literature and music 69 continuing racial tensions and violence such as the chicago race riot of 1919 also occurred 70 the ratification of the 18th amendment to the constitution in 1919 made the production and sale including exportation of alcoholic beverages illegal in the united states this ushered in the beginning of what is known as the gangster era a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when prohibition was repealed the 1920s saw gangsters including al capone dion obanion bugs moran and tony accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of chicago during the prohibition era 71 chicago was the location of the infamous st valentines day massacre in 1929 when al capone sent men to gun down members of a rival gang north side led by bugs moran 72 from 1920 to 1921 the city was affected by a series of tenant rent strikes which lead to the formation of the chicago tenants protective association passage of the kessenger tenant laws and of a heat ordinance that legally required flats to be kept above 68 °f during winter months by landlords 73 74 75 76 77 78 chicago was the first american city to have a homosexual-rights organization the organization formed in 1924 was called the society for human rights it produced the first american publication for homosexuals friendship and freedom police and political pressure caused the organization to disband 79 the great depression brought unprecedented suffering to chicago in no small part due to the citys heavy reliance on heavy industry notably industrial areas on the south side and neighborhoods lining both branches of the chicago river were devastated by 1933 over 50% of industrial jobs in the city had been lost and unemployment rates amongst blacks and mexicans in the city were over 40% the republican political machine in chicago was utterly destroyed by the economic crisis and every mayor since 1931 has been a democrat 80 from 1928 to 1933 the city witnessed a tax revolt and the city was unable to meet payroll or provide relief efforts the fiscal crisis was resolved by 1933 and at the same time federal relief funding began to flow into chicago 80 chicago was also a hotbed of labor activism with unemployed councils contributing heavily in the early depression to create solidarity for the poor and demand relief these organizations were created by socialist and communist groups by 1935 the workers alliance of america begun organizing the poor workers the unemployed in the spring of 1937 republic steel works witnessed the memorial day massacre of 1937 in the neighborhood of east side in 1933 chicago mayor anton cermak was fatally wounded in miami florida during a failed assassination attempt on president-elect franklin d roosevelt in 1933 and 1934 the city celebrated its centennial by hosting the century of progress international exposition worlds fair 81 the theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since chicagos founding 82 during world war ii the city of chicago alone produced more steel than the united kingdom every year from 1939 – 1945 and more than nazi germany from 1943 – 1945 83 the great migration which had been on pause due to the depression resumed at an even faster pace in the second wave as hundreds of thousands of blacks from the south arrived in the city to work in the steel mills railroads and shipping yards 84 on december 2 1942 physicist enrico fermi conducted the worlds first controlled nuclear reaction at the university of chicago as part of the top-secret manhattan project this led to the creation of the atomic bomb by the united states which it used in world war ii in 1945 85 mayor richard j daley a democrat was elected in 1955 in the era of machine politics in 1956 the city conducted its last major expansion when it annexed the land under ohare airport including a small portion of dupage county 86 by the 1960s white residents in several neighborhoods left the city for the suburban areas – in many american cities a process known as white flight – as blacks continued to move beyond the black belt 87 while home loan discriminatory redlining against blacks continued the real estate industry practiced what became known as blockbusting completely changing the racial composition of whole neighborhoods 88 structural changes in industry such as globalization and job outsourcing caused heavy job losses for lower-skilled workers at its peak during the 1960s some 250000 workers were employed in the steel industry in chicago but the steel crisis of the 1970s and 1980s reduced this number to just 28000 in 2015 in 1966 martin luther king jr and albert raby led the chicago freedom movement which culminated in agreements between mayor richard j daley and the movement leaders 89 two years later the city hosted the tumultuous 1968 democratic national convention which featured physical confrontations both inside and outside the convention hall with anti-war protesters journalists and bystanders being beaten by police 90 major construction projects including the sears tower now known as the willis tower which in 1974 became the worlds tallest building university of illinois at chicago mccormick place and ohare international airport were undertaken during richard j daleys tenure 91 in 1979 jane byrne the citys first female mayor was elected she was notable for temporarily moving into the crime-ridden cabrini-green housing project and for leading chicagos school system out of a financial crisis 92 in 1983 harold washington became the first black mayor of chicago washingtons first term in office directed attention to poor and previously neglected minority neighborhoods he was re‑elected in 1987 but died of a heart attack soon after 93 washington was succeeded by 6th ward alderperson eugene sawyer who was elected by the chicago city council and served until a special election richard m daley son of richard j daley was elected in 1989 his accomplishments included improvements to parks and creating incentives for sustainable development as well as closing meigs field in the middle of the night and destroying the runways after successfully running for re-election five times and becoming chicagos longest-serving mayor richard m daley declined to run for a seventh term 94 95 in 1992 a construction accident near the kinzie street bridge produced a breach connecting the chicago river to a tunnel below which was part of an abandoned freight tunnel system extending throughout the downtown loop district the tunnels filled with 250 million us gallons 1000000 m 3 of water affecting buildings throughout the district and forcing a shutdown of electrical power 96 the area was shut down for three days and some buildings did not reopen for weeks losses were estimated at $1.95 billion 96 on february 23 2011 rahm emanuel a former white house chief of staff and member of the house of representatives won the mayoral election 97 emanuel was sworn in as mayor on may 16 2011 and won re-election in 2015 98 lori lightfoot the citys first african american woman mayor and its first openly lgbtq mayor was elected to succeed emanuel as mayor in 2019 99 all three city-wide elective offices were held by women and women of color for the first time in chicago history in addition to lightfoot the city clerk was anna valencia and the city treasurer was melissa conyears-ervin 100 on may 15 2023 brandon johnson assumed office as the 57th mayor of chicago ## geography ## topography chicago is located in northeastern illinois on the southwestern shores of freshwater lake michigan it is the principal city in the chicago metropolitan area situated in both the midwestern united states and the great lakes region the city rests on a continental divide at the site of the chicago portage connecting the mississippi river and the great lakes watersheds in addition to it lying beside lake michigan two rivers—the chicago river in downtown and the calumet river in the industrial far south side—flow either entirely or partially through the city 101 102 chicagos history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to lake michigan while the chicago river historically handled much of the regions waterborne cargo todays huge lake freighters use the citys lake calumet harbor on the south side the lake also provides another positive effect moderating chicagos climate making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer 103 when chicago was founded in 1837 most of the early building was around the mouth of the chicago river as can be seen on a map of the citys original 58 blocks 104 the overall grade of the citys central built-up areas is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise the average land elevation is 579 ft 176.5 m above sea level while measurements vary somewhat 105 the lowest points are along the lake shore at 578 ft 176.2 m while the highest point at 672 ft 205 m is the morainal ridge of blue island in the citys far south side 106 lake shore drive runs adjacent to a large portion of chicagos waterfront some of the parks along the waterfront include lincoln park grant park burnham park and jackson park there are 24 public beaches across 26 miles 42 km of the waterfront 107 landfill extends into portions of the lake providing space for navy pier northerly island the museum campus and large portions of the mccormick place convention center most of the citys high-rise commercial and residential buildings are close to the waterfront an informal name for the entire chicago metropolitan area is chicagoland which generally means the city and all its suburbs though different organizations have slightly different definitions 108 109 110 ## communities major sections of the city include the central business district called the loop and the north south and west sides 111 the three sides of the city are represented on the flag of chicago by three horizontal white stripes 112 the north side is the most-densely-populated residential section of the city and many high-rises are located on this side of the city along the lakefront 113 the south side is the largest section of the city encompassing roughly 60% of the citys land area the south side contains most of the facilities of the port of chicago 114 in the late-1920s sociologists at the university of chicago subdivided the city into 77 distinct community areas which can further be subdivided into over 200 informally defined neighborhoods 115 116 ## streetscape chicagos streets were laid out in a street grid that grew from the citys original townsite plot which was bounded by lake michigan on the east north avenue on the north wood street on the west and 22nd street on the south 117 streets following the public land survey system section lines later became arterial streets in outlying sections as new additions to the city were platted city ordinance required them to be laid out with eight streets to the mile in one direction and sixteen in the other direction about one street per 200 meters in one direction and one street per 100 meters in the other direction the grids regularity provided an efficient means of developing new real estate property a scattering of diagonal streets many of them originally native american trails also cross the city elston milwaukee ogden lincoln etc many additional diagonal streets were recommended in the plan of chicago but only the extension of ogden avenue was ever constructed 118 in 2021 chicago was ranked the fourth-most walkable large city in the united states 119 many of the citys residential streets have a wide patch of grass or trees between the street and the sidewalk itself this helps to keep pedestrians on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic chicagos western avenue is the longest continuous urban street in the world 120 other notable streets include michigan avenue state street 95th street cicero avenue clark street and belmont avenue the city beautiful movement inspired chicagos boulevards and parkways 121 ## architecture the destruction caused by the great chicago fire led to the largest building boom in the history of the nation in 1885 the first steel-framed high-rise building the home insurance building rose in the city as chicago ushered in the skyscraper era 53 which would then be followed by many other cities around the world 122 today chicagos skyline is among the worlds tallest and densest 123 some of the united states tallest towers are located in chicago willis tower formerly sears tower is the second tallest building in the western hemisphere after one world trade center and trump international hotel and tower is the third tallest in the country 124 the loops historic buildings include the chicago board of trade building the fine arts building 35 east wacker and the chicago building 860-880 lake shore drive apartments by mies van der rohe many other architects have left their impression on the chicago skyline such as daniel burnham louis sullivan charles b atwood john root and helmut jahn 125 126 the merchandise mart once first on the list of largest buildings in the world currently listed as 44th-largest 2013 as september 9 2013 had its own zip code until 2008 and stands near the junction of the north and south branches of the chicago river 127 presently the four tallest buildings in the city are willis tower formerly the sears tower also a building with its own zip code trump international hotel and tower the aon center previously the standard oil building and the john hancock center industrial districts such as some areas on the south side the areas along the chicago sanitary and ship canal and the northwest indiana area are clustered 128 chicago gave its name to the chicago school and was home to the prairie school two movements in architecture 129 multiple kinds and scales of houses townhouses condominiums and apartment buildings can be found throughout chicago large swaths of the citys residential areas away from the lake are characterized by brick bungalows built from the early 20th century through the end of world war ii chicago is also a prominent center of the polish cathedral style of church architecture the chicago suburb of oak park was home to famous architect frank lloyd wright who had designed the robie house located near the university of chicago 130 131 a popular tourist activity is to take an architecture boat tour along the chicago river 132 ## monuments and public art chicago is famous for its outdoor public art with donors establishing funding for such art as far back as benjamin ferguson s 1905 trust 133 a number of chicagos public art works are by modern figurative artists among these are chagalls four seasons the chicago picasso miros chicago calders flamingo oldenburgs batcolumn moores large interior form 1953-54 man enters the cosmos and nuclear energy dubuffets monument with standing beast abakanowiczs agora and anish kapoor s cloud gate which has become an icon of the city some events which shaped the citys history have also been memorialized by art works including the great northern migration saar and the centennial of statehood for illinois finally two fountains near the loop also function as monumental works of art plensas crown fountain as well as burnham and bennetts buckingham fountain 134 135 ## climate the city lies within the typical hot-summer humid continental climate köppen dfa and experiences four distinct seasons 136 137 138 summers are hot and humid with frequent heat waves the july daily average temperature is 75.4 °f 24.1 °c with afternoon temperatures peaking at 84.5 °f 29.2 °c in a normal summer temperatures reach at least 90 °f 32 °c on 17 days with lakefront locations staying cooler when winds blow off the lake winters are relatively cold and snowy blizzards do occur such as in winter 2011 139 there are many sunny but cold days the normal winter high from december through march is about 36 °f 2 °c january and february are the coldest months a polar vortex in january 2019 nearly broke the citys cold record of −27 °f −33 °c which was set on january 20 1985 140 141 142 measurable snowfall can continue through the first or second week of april 143 spring and autumn are mild short seasons typically with low humidity dew point temperatures in the summer range from an average of 55.8 °f 13.2 °c in june to 61.7 °f 16.5 °c in july 144 they can reach nearly 80 °f 27 °c such as during the july 2019 heat wave the city lies within usda plant hardiness zone 6a transitioning to 5b in the suburbs 145 according to the national weather service chicagos highest official temperature reading of 105 °f 41 °c was recorded on july 24 1934 146 midway airport reached 109 °f 43 °c one day prior and recorded a heat index of 125 °f 52 °c during the 1995 heatwave 147 the lowest official temperature of −27 °f −33 °c was recorded on january 20 1985 at ohare airport 144 147 most of the citys rainfall is brought by thunderstorms averaging 38 a year the region is prone to severe thunderstorms during the spring and summer which can produce large hail damaging winds and occasionally tornadoes 148 like other major cities chicago experiences an urban heat island making the city and its suburbs milder than surrounding rural areas especially at night and in winter the proximity to lake michigan tends to keep the chicago lakefront somewhat cooler in summer and less brutally cold in winter than inland parts of the city and suburbs away from the lake 149 northeast winds from wintertime cyclones departing south of the region sometimes bring the city lake-effect snow 150 climate data for chicago midway international airport 1991–2020 normals b extremes 1928–present month | jan | feb | mar |
