survived the war years 49 in mid-august of 1862 wilmington was devastated by a deadly outbreak of yellow fever this fever outbreak was brought about by a blockade runner named kate sources suggest that the runner had crew members who were sick before the ship landed but dr wt wragg would later write an article in the new york journal of medicine that there were at least five cases in the city before the ship arrived dr wragg treated many of the yellow fever victims during the outbreak and claimed that the dirtiness of the city and the fumes of the dirty water left by heavy rains caused the disease by the end of the outbreak at least 1500 and perhaps as many as 2000 contracted yellow fever of those between 650 and 800 died a mortality rate approximately 40 percent walter reed would later discover in 1900 that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes so wilmingtons outbreak had to be introduced by a third party and spread by mosquitoes in the city 50 51 reconstruction era and 1898

republican voting white democrats regained control of the state legislature and sought to impose white supremacy but some blacks continued to be elected to local offices 56 the wilmington insurrection of 1898 also known as the wilmington race riot occurred as a result of the racially charged political conflict that had occurred in the decades after the civil war and efforts by white democrats to re-establish white supremacy and overturn black voting in 1898 a cadre of white democrats professionals and businessmen planned to overthrow the city government if their candidates were not elected two days after the election in which a white republican was elected mayor and both white and black aldermen were elected more than 1500 white men led by democrat alfred m waddell an unsuccessful
