in 1602 spanish maritime explorersebastián vizcaínogave the name santa barbara to the channel and also to one of thechannel islands 16 a landexpeditionled bygaspar de portolàvisited around 1769 and franciscan missionaryjuan crespi who accompanied the expedition named a large native town laguna de la concepcion cabrillos earlier name however is the one that has survived the first permanent european residents were spanish missionaries and soldiers underfelipe de neve who arrived in 1782 and constructed thepresidio they were sent to both secure the spanish claim to the region and to convert theindigenous peoplestocatholicism many of the spaniards brought their families with them and those formed the nucleus of the small town – at first just a cluster of adobes – that surrounded thepresidio of santa barbara the santa barbara mission was established on the feast ofsaint barbara december 4 1786 it was the tenth of the california missions to be founded by the spanish franciscans 17 it was dedicated by padrefermín lasuén who succeeded padrejunipero serraas the second president and founder of the california franciscan mission chain the chumash laborers built a connection between the canyon creek and the santa barbara mission water system through the use of a dam and an aqueduct 18 during the following decades many of the natives died of diseases such assmallpox against which they had nonatural immunity 19 the most dramatic event of the spanish period was the powerful1812 earthquake andtsunami with an estimated magnitude of 7.1 which destroyed the mission as well as the rest of the town water reached as high as present-day anapamu street and carried a ship half a mile up refugio canyon 20 21 the mission was rebuilt by 1820 after the earthquake 22 following the earthquake the mission fathers chose to rebuild in a grander manner and it is this construction that survives to the present day the best-preserved of the california missions and still functioning as an active church by the franciscans after the mexican government secularized the missions in the 1830s the baptismal marriage and burial records of other missions were transferred to santa barbara and now found in thesanta barbara mission archive-library 23 the spanish period ended in 1822 with the conclusion of themexican war of independence which terminated 300 years of spanish colonial rule and transferred control to the newly independent mexican government santa barbara street names reflect the influence of the spanish period the namesde le guerraandcarrillocome from theguerra family of californiaandcarrillo family of california they were instrumental in building up the town so they were honored by having streets named after them 24 ### mexican era after the forcedsecularization of the missions in 1833 successivemexican governorsdistributed the large land tracts formerly held by the franciscan order to various families in order to reward service or build alliances these land grants to local notable families mark the beginning of the rancho period in california and santa barbara history fernando tico was one of the first settlers who received land grants for the local area fernando led the native americans against the argentinian pirates in the 1800s the population remained sparse with enormous cattle operations run by wealthy families it was during this period thatrichard henry dana jrfirst visited santa barbara and wrote about thecultureand people of santa barbara in his booktwo years before the mast santa barbara fell bloodlessly to a battalion ofamerican soldiersunderjohn c frémonton december 27 1846 during themexican–american war and after thetreaty of guadalupe hidalgoin 1848 it became part of the expanding united states 25 26 ### post-conquest era change came quickly in santa barbara following the americanconquest of california the population doubled between 1850 and 1860 in 1851 land surveyor salisbury haley designed the street grid famously botching the block measurements misaligning the streets thereby creating doglegs at certain intersections 27 wood construction replaced adobe as american settlers moved in during thegold rush yearsand following the town became a haven for bandits and gamblers and a dangerous and lawless place charismatic gambler andhighwaymanjack powershad virtual control of the town in the early 1850s until driven out by a posse organized in san luis obispo english gradually supplanted spanish as the language of daily life becoming the language of official record in 1870 28 the first newspaper thesanta barbara gazette was founded in 1855 29 while thecivil warhad little effect on santa barbara the disastrous drought of 1863 ended the rancho period as most of the cattle died and ranchos were broken up and sold mortimer cook a wealthy entrepreneur arrived in 1871 and opened the citys first bank cook later served two terms as mayor 30 cook founded the first national gold bank of santa barbara in 1873 the building ofstearns wharfin 1872 enhanced santa barbaras commercial and tourist accessibility previously goods and visitors had to transfer fromsteamboatsto smaller craft to row ashore during the 1870s writercharles nordhoffpromoted the town as a health resort and destination for well-to-do travelers from other parts of the us many of them came and many stayed the luxuriousarlington hoteldated from this period in 1887 the railroad finally went through to los angeles and in 1901 to san francisco santa barbara was now easily accessible by land and by sea and subsequent development was brisk 31 santa barbara had asystem of street railwaysthat operated from 1875 through 1929 begun as a single mule-drawn line from the waterfront pier to the arlington hotel over the decades it was incrementally expanded later electrified and operated until its closure in june 1929 peter j barber an architect designed many late victorian style residences and served twice as mayor in 1880 and again in 1890 a year after barbers term as mayor president benjamin harrison became the first of five presidents to visit santa barbara 32 ### early 20th century to world war ii just before the turn of the 20th century oil was discovered at thesummerland oil field and the region along the beach east of santa barbara sprouted numerous oil derricks and piers fordrilling offshore this was the first offshore oil development in the world oil drilling offshore would become a contentious practice in the santa barbara area which continues to the present day 33 santa barbara housed the worlds largest movie studio during the era of silent film flying a studios a division of theamerican film manufacturing company operated on two city blocks centered at state and mission between 1910 and 1922 with the industry shutting down locally and moving tohollywoodonce it outgrew the area needing the resources of a larger city flying a and the other smaller local studios produced approximately 1200 films during their tenure in santa barbara of which approximately 100 survive 34 35 36 during this period theloughead aircraft companywas established on lower state street and regularly testedseaplanesoff of east beach this was the genesis of what would later becomelockheed the magnitude 6.3 37 38 earthquake of june 29 1925 the first destructive earthquake in california since the1906 san francisco quake destroyed much of downtown santa barbara and killed 13 people the earthquake caused infrastructure to collapse including the sheffield dam 39 the low death toll is attributed to the early hour 644 am before most people were out on the streets vulnerable to falling masonry while this quake like the one in 1812 was centered in the santa barbara channel it caused no tsunami it came at an opportune time for rebuilding since a movement for architectural reform and unification around aspanish colonial stylewas already underway under the leadership ofpearl chase many of the citys famous buildings rose as part of the rebuilding process including thesanta barbara county courthouse sometimes praised as the most beautiful public building in the united states in 1907 in northern santa barbara county a horrific train accident claimed the lives of 37 the exact cause of which is still unknown it is still the deadliest disaster in the santa barbara history 40 during world war ii santa barbara was home tomarine corps air station santa barbara andnaval reserve center santa barbaraat the harbor up the coast west of the city was the armys camp cooke the present-dayvandenberg space force base in the city hoff general hospital treated servicemen wounded in thepacific theatre 41 on february 23 1942 not long after the outbreak of war in the pacific the japanese submarinei-17surfaced offshore andlobbed 16 shellsat theellwood oil field about 10 miles 15 km west of santa barbara in the first shelling attack by an enemy power on the continental us since thebombardment of orleansinworld war i although the shelling was inaccurate and only caused about $500 damage to a catwalk panic was immediate many santa barbara residents fled and land values plummeted to historic lows ### after world war ii after the war many of the servicemen who had seen santa barbara returned to stay the population surged by 10000 people between the end of the war and 1950 this burst of growth had dramatic consequences for the local economy and infrastructurehighway 101was built through town during this period and newly builtlake cachumabegan supplying water via a tunnel dug through the mountains between 1950 and 1956 42 local relations with the oil industry gradually soured through the period production at summerland had ended elwood was winding down and to find new fields oil companies carried out seismic exploration of the channel using explosives a controversial practice that local fishermen claimed harmed their catch the culminating disaster and one of the formative events in the modern environmental movement was theblowout at union oils platform aon thedos cuadras field about eight miles 13 km southeast of santa barbara in the santa barbara channel on january 28 1969 approximately 100000 barrels 16000 m3 of oil surged out of a huge undersea break fouling hundreds of square miles of ocean and all the coastline from ventura to goleta as well north facing beaches on the channel islands two legislative consequences of the spill in the next year were the passages of the california environmental quality act ceqa and thenational environmental policy act nepa locally outraged citizens formed goo get oil out 43 santa barbaras business community strove to attract development until the surge in the anti-growth movement in the 1970s many clean industries especially aerospace firms such as raytheon and delco electronics moved to town in the 1950s and 1960s bringing employees from other parts of the us ucsb itself became a major employer 43 in 1975 the city passed an ordinance restricting growth to a maximum of 85000 residents through zoning growth in the adjacent goleta valley could be shut down by denying water meters to developers seeking permits as a result of these changes growth slowed down but prices rose sharply 44 45 when voters approved connection to state water supplies in 1991 parts of the city especially outlying areas resumed growth but more slowly than during the boom period of the 1950s and 1960s while the slower growth preserved the quality of life for most residents and prevented theurban sprawlnotorious in thelos angeles basin housing in the santa barbara area was in short supply and prices soared in 2006 only six percent of residents could afford a median-value house as a result many people who work in santa barbara commute from adjacent more affordable areas such as santa marialompoc and ventura the resultant traffic on incoming arteries in particular the stretch of highway 101 between ventura and santa barbara is another problem being addressed by long-range planners 46 since the middle of the twentieth century several destructive fires have affected santa barbara the 1964 coyote fire which burned 67000 acres 270 km2 of backcountry along with 106 homes the smaller but quickly moving sycamore fire in 1977 which burned 200 homes the disastrous 1990painted cave fire which incinerated over 500 homes in only several hours during an intensesundowner windevent the november 2008tea fire which destroyed 210 homes in the foothills of santa barbara andmontecito and the 2009jesusita firethat burned 8733 acres 35.34 km2 and destroyed 160 homes above thesan roqueregion of santa barbara 47 48 thethomas fireburned from its origins insanta paula60 miles 100 km to the east of santa barbara and consumed 281893 acres 1140.78 km2 in santa barbara and ventura counties most of which consisted of rural land and wilderness areas the fire started december 4 2017 and was 100% contained by january 12 2018 1050 structures were lost in the thomas fire mostly east of santa barbara in ventura county the thomas fire has been the largest santa barbara county fire ever recorded to date ### geography santa barbara is located about 90 miles 145 km west-northwest oflos angeles along thepacificcoast this stretch of coast along southernsanta barbara countyis sometimes referred to as the american riviera 49 presumably because its geography and climate are similar to that of areas along the northernmediterranean seacoast especially in southern france known as theriviera thesanta ynez mountains an east–west trending range rise dramatically behind the city with several peaks exceeding 4000 feet 1200 m covered withchaparral oaks andsandstoneoutcrops they make a scenic backdrop to the town sometimes perhaps once every three years snow falls on the mountains but it rarely stays for more than a few days nearer to town directly east and adjacent tomission santa barbara is an east–west ridge known locally as the riviera traversed by a road called alameda padre serra shortened aps which translates to father serras pathway according to theunited states census bureau the city has a total area of 42.0 square miles 108.8 km2 of which 19.5 square miles 51 km2 of it is land and 22.5 square miles 58 km2 of it 53.61% is water the high official figures for water is due to the extension of the city limit into the ocean including a strip of city reaching out into the sea and inland again to keep the santa barbara airport sba within the city boundary ### climate santa barbara experiences awarm-summer mediterranean climate köppen csb characteristic of coastal california santa barbaras weather was ranked number 1 in the united states in 2018 by us news & world report because the city lies along the ocean and parallel to the predominant westerly winds sideshore and light onshore breezes moderate temperatures resulting in warmer winters and cooler summers compared with places farther inland in the winter storms reach california some of which bring heavy rainfall but therain shadoweffect of the coastal mountains can at times moderate or enhance the rainfall depending on local storm wind flows local rainfall totals can be enhanced byorographic liftwhen storms are accompanied by southerly flow pushing moist air over the santa ynez mountains producing greater rainfall than in other coastal areasdiurnal temperature variationreaches a maximum in winter due to lower humidity and the absence of summer fog on average only 1.7 nights have freezing lows 50 in general summers are warm with very few hot days exceeding 90 degrees and winters are comfortable and sometimes warm with occasional cooler days topping out around 54-58 degrees most days from december to february have highs of 63-69 degrees and most days from june to august have highs of 72-84 degrees summers in santa barbara are mostly rainless due to the presence of a high-pressure area over the eastern pacific but summer showers can happen due to tropical hurricane monsoonal flows that rarely reach the region thunderstorms can also occur during thenorth american monsoon in the fall afternoon or evening downslope winds locally called sundowners can raise temperatures into the high 90s °f high 30s °c and drop humidities into the single digits increasing the chance of wildfires along with their severity due to downed power lines etc in the foothills north of the city annual rainfall totals are highly variable and in exceptional years like 1940–1941 and 1997–1998 over 40 inches 1.0 m of rain have fallen in a year 51 but in dry seasons less than 6 inches 150 mm is not unheard of snow sometimes covers higher elevations of the santa ynez mountains but is extremely rare in the city itself the most recent accumulating snow to fall near sea level was in january 1949 when approximately 2 inches 5.1 cm fell in the city 52 ### geology and soils the city of santa barbara is situated on a coastal plain between thesanta ynez mountainsand the sea this coastal plain consists of a complex array ofholoceneandpleistocenealluvialandcolluvialdepositsmarine terraces debris flows andestuarinedeposits 56 57 soils are mostly well drained brown finesandy loamof the milpitas series 58 rapid geologic uplift is characteristic of the entire region as evidenced by the coastal bluffs and narrow beaches that are present along most of the coastline 59 downtown santa barbara occupies a floodplain between two major geologic faults the mission ridge fault zone to the north and the mesa fault to the south the mission ridge fault zone runs along the range of hills known locally as the riviera and the mesa fault defines the northern boundary of the band of hills called the mesa these two faults converge near the five points shopping center at los positas and state streets neither is well-exposed with their locations being inferred from topography springs seeps and well logs 61 the mesa fault continues southeast offshore into the santa barbara channel the portion of the fault offshore is believed to have been responsible for the destructiveearthquake of 1925 62 the mission ridge fault trends east–west being named the more ranch fault west of santa barbara and forms the northern boundary of the uplands which includeisla vista more mesa and thehope ranchhills 63 three major sedimentary bedrock units underlie the coastal plain themonterey formation thesisquoc formation and the santa barbara formation the santa barbara formation is one of the main units in theaquiferunderlying the city its coarse-grained freshwater-bearing portion much of which is below sea level is protected from seawater intrusion by the more ranch fault which has shielded it by uplifting less-permeable rocks between it and the sea the majority of water wells in the santa barbara-goleta area pull from this geologic unit 64 the santa ynez mountains to the north of the city consist of multiple layers of sandstone andconglomerateunits dating from thejurassic ageto the present uplifted rapidly since thepliocene upended and in some areas completely overturned rapid uplift has given these mountains their craggy scenic character and numerous landslides and debris flows which form some of the urban and suburban lowland area are testament to their geologically active nature 65 ### architecture the first monterey-style adobe in california was built on state street of santa barbara by the wealthy merchant alpheus thompson 66 the dominant architectural themes of santa barbara are themediterranean revivalspanish colonial revivaland the relatedmission revival style encouraged through design guidelines adopted by city leaders after the 1925 earthquake destroyed
