relation to a street one block east of pacific avenue and 6th avenue or division avenue both beginning in downtown tacoma within the city and with a few exceptions east-to-west streets are numbered and north-to-south streets are given a name or a letter some east-to-west streets are also given names such as s center st and n westgate blvd streets are generally labeled north south east or north east according to their relationship with 6th avenue or division avenue west of division ave 6th avenue is the lowest-numbered street making it the dividing street between north and south a street which is the dividing line between east and south or 1st street ne which is the dividing line between east and north east this can lead to confusion as most named streets intersect streets of the same number in both north and south tacoma for example the intersection of south 11th street and south union avenue is just ten blocks south of north 11th street and north union avenue to the east of the thea foss waterway and a street streets are similarly divided into east and northeast with 1st street ne being in-line with the pierce–king county line north east covers a small wedge of tacoma and

most notable are tyler st stevens st oakes st pine st cedar st alder st and s 72nd st s 74th st these major arterials actually shift over to align with other roads which causes them to have the name changed this numeric system extends to the furthest reaches of unincorporated pierce county with roads outside of the city carrying east west north west and south west except on the key peninsula which retains the north–south streets but chooses the pierce–kitsap county line as the zero point for east–west streets until 2018 key peninsulas roads also carried a kp n or kp s key peninsula north or key peninsula south designation at the end of the street name from 2018 these designations have switched to nw and sw respectively in portions of the city dating back to the tacoma streetcar period
