of seloy this site was chosen for its strategic location facing the waterways of st augustine bay with their abundant resources an eminently suitable site for water communications and defense 26 a french attack on st augustine was thwarted by a violent squall that ravaged the french naval forces taking advantage of this menéndez marched his troops overland to fort caroline on thest johns river about 30 miles 50 km north the spanish easily overwhelmed the lightly defended french garrison which had been left with only a skeleton crew of 20 soldiers and about 100 others killing most of the men and sparing about 60 women and children the bodies of the victims were hung in trees with the inscription hanged not as frenchmen but as lutherans heretics 27 28 menéndez renamed the fortsan mateoand

townspeople to evacuate the settlement when the english got ashore they seized some artillery pieces and a royal strongbox containing goldducats which was the garrison payroll 31 the killing of their sergeant major by the spanish rearguard caused drake to order the town razed to the ground 32 33 in 1609 and 1611 expeditions were sent out from st augustine against the english colony atjamestown 34

growingfree blackcommunity established byfugitive slaveswho had escaped into florida from thethirteen colonies this new communityfort mose would serve as a military outpost and buffer for st augustine as the men accepted into fort mose had enlisted in the florida militia and converted to catholicism in exchange for their freedom 42 43 in 1740 however st augustine was again besieged this time by the governor of the britishcolony of georgia generaljames oglethorpe who was also unable to take the fort 44 ### loyalist haven under british period the1763 treaty of paris signed aftergreat britains victory over france and spain during theseven years war ceded florida to great britain in exchange for the return ofhavanaandmanila many spanish settlers in the region left florida forcubaand because

and struggled to maintain a tenuous hold on its territories in the western hemisphere asrevolutionswept south america the royal administration of florida was neglected as the province had long been regarded as an unprofitable backwater by the crown the united states however considered florida vital to its political and military interests as it expanded its territory in north america and maneuvered by sometimes clandestine means to acquire it 50 on october 5 1811 a hurricane hit st augustine that caused extensive damage to the city the damage was further exacerbated by the economic situation of spanish florida 51 theadams–onís treaty negotiated in 1819 and ratified in 1821 ceded florida and st augustine still its capital at the time to the united states 52 ### territory of

move to the area west florida was quickly consolidated with east and the new capital of florida became tallahassee halfway between the old capitals of st augustine and pensacola in 1824 53 once many americans had begun to immigrate to the new territory it became apparent that there would be continued skirmishes with local creek and miccosukee peoples and white settlers encroaching on their land

governor william duval and james gadsden signed thetreaty of moultrie creek forcing seminoles onto a four million acre reservation in central florida the second seminole war 1835–1842 was the longest

and the railroad henry flagler a co-founder withjohn d rockefellerof thestandard oil company spent the winter of 1883 in st augustine and found the city charming but considered its hotels and transportation systems inadequate 63 he had the idea to make st augustine a winter resort for wealthy americans from the north and to bring them south he bought several short line railroads and combined these in 1885 to form theflorida east coast railway he built a railroad bridge over the st johns river in 1888 opening up the atlantic coast of florida to development 64 65 flagler finished construction in 1887 on two large ornate hotels in the city the 450-roomhotel ponce de leonand the 250-roomhotel alcazar the next year he purchased thecasa monica hotel renaming it the cordova hotel across the street from both the alcazar and the ponce de leon his chosen architectural firmcarrère and hastings radically altered the appearance of st augustine with these hotels giving it askylineand beginning an architectural trend in the state characterized by the use of thespanish renaissance revivalandmoorish revivalstyles with the opening of the ponce de leon in 1888 st augustine became the winter resort of american high society for a few years 66 when flaglersflorida east coast railroadwas extended southward topalm beachand thenmiamiin the early 20th century the wealthy stopped in st augustine en route to the southern resorts wealthy vacationers began to customarily spend their winters in south florida where the climate was warmer and freezes were rare st augustine nevertheless
