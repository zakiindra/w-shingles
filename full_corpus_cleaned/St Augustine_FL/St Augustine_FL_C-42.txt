and the railroad henry flagler a co-founder withjohn d rockefellerof thestandard oil company spent the winter of 1883 in st augustine and found the city charming but considered its hotels and transportation systems inadequate 44 he had the idea to make st augustine a winter resort for wealthy americans from the north and to bring them south he bought several short line railroads and combined these in 1885 to form theflorida east coast railway he built a railroad bridge over the st johns river in 1888 opening up the atlantic coast of florida to development 45 46 flagler finished construction in 1887 on two large ornate hotels in the city the 450-roomhotel ponce de leonand the 250-roomhotel alcazar the next year he purchased thecasa monica hotel renaming it the cordova hotel across the street from both the alcazar and the ponce de leon his chosen architectural firmcarrère and hastings radically altered the appearance of st augustine with these hotels giving it askylineand beginning an architectural trend in the state characterized by the use of thespanish renaissance revivalandmoorish revivalstyles with the opening of the ponce de leon in 1888 st augustine became the winter resort of american high society for a few years 47 when flaglersflorida east coast railroadwas extended southward topalm beachand thenmiamiin the early 20th century the wealthy stopped in st augustine en route to the southern resorts wealthy vacationers began to customarily spend their winters in south florida where the climate was warmer and freezes were rare st augustine nevertheless
