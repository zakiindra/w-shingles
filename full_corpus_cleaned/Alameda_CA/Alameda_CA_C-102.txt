communities alameda has a municipal power and telecommunications service that delivers services directly to consumers the telecommunications service has the potential of far exceeding the capabilities of the various cable and dsl providers in the larger region there have been proposals by the power producer to produce energy from waste but not within the city of alameda instead this energy would be produced at a waste transfer station located in neighboring and downwind san leandro owing to the expected release of toxic emissions from what is essentially a garbage incinerator the mayor and city council of san leandro were not pleased the mayor vowed to fight this proposal suggesting that alameda could instead place this near their municipal golf course also unlike the three major power producers in california alameda is not required to establish net metering for home photovoltaic power producers so the city currently lags far behind other communities in producing truly green energy even though they have what could be a very productive site for wind energy on the western edge of the former naval air station here external links edit city of alameda official web page alameda
