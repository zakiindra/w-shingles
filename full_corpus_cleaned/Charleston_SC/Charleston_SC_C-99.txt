shiploads of settlers frombermudaandbarbados 13 14 these settlers established what was then called charles town at albemarle point on the west bank of the ashley river a few miles northwest of the present-day city center 15 charles town became the first comprehensively planned town in thethirteen colonies its governance settlement and development was to follow a visionary plan known as thegrand modelprepared for the lords proprietors byjohn locke 16 because thecarolinas fundamental constitutionswas never ratified however charles town was never incorporated during the colonial period insteadlocal ordinanceswere passed by the provincial government with day-to-day administration handled by thewardensandvestriesofstphilipsandstmichaelsanglicanparishes 15 at the time ofeuropean colonization the area was inhabited by the indigenouscusabo on whom the settlers declared war in october 1671 the settlers initially allied with thewesto a northern indigenous tribe that traded in enslaved indians the settlers abandoned their alliance with the westo in 1679 and allied with the cusabo instead 17 the initial settlement quickly dwindled away and disappeared while another village—established by the settlers on oyster point at the confluence of the ashley and cooper rivers around 1672 15 —thrived this second settlement formally replaced the original charles town in 1680 18 the original site is now commemorated ascharles towne landing the second location was more defensible and had access to a fine natural harbor the new town had become the fifth largest in north america by 1690 19 asmallpoxoutbreak erupted in 1698 followed by an earthquake in february 1699 the latter caused a fire that destroyed about a third of the town during rebuilding 20 ayellow

health problem through most of the citys history before dying out in the 1950s after use of pesticides cut down on the mosquitoes that transmitted it 21 charles town was fortified according to a plan

cooper rivers became one at least seventy people died in the disaster 22 23 from the 1670s charleston attracted pirates the combination of a weak government and corruption made the city popular with pirates who frequently visited and raided the city charles town was besieged by the pirateblackbeardfor several days in may 1718 blackbeard released his hostages and left in exchange for a chest of medicine fromgovernor robert johnson 24 around 1719 the towns name began to be generally written as charlestown 15 and excepting those fronting the cooper river the old walls were largely removed over the next decade charlestown was a center for the inland colonization ofsouth carolina it remained the southernmost point of thesouthern coloniesuntil theprovince of georgiawas established in 1732 as noted the first settlers primarily came fromeuropebarbadosandbermuda the barbadian and bermudan immigrants were planters who brought enslaved africans with them having purchased them in thewest indies early immigrant groups to the city included thehuguenotsscottishirish andgermans as well ashundreds of jews predominatelysephardifromlondonand major cities of thedutch republic where they had been given refuge 25 as late as 1830 charlestons jewish community was the largest and wealthiestin north america 25 26 by 1708 the majority of the colonys population wereblackafricans they had been brought

migrated from thewest indies being descendants of white planters and their black consorts and unions among the working classes 27 in 1767 gadsdens wharf was constructed at the city port on the cooper river it ultimately extended 840 feet and was able to accommodate six ships at a time many slaves were sold from here 28 devoted to plantation agriculture that depended on enslaved labor south carolina became a slave society it had a majority-black population from the colonial period until after thegreat migrationof the early 20th century when many rural blacks moved to northern and midwestern industrial cities to escapejim crow laws at the foundation of the town the principal items of commerce werepinetimberandpitchforshipsandtobacco the early economy developed around thedeerskintrade in which colonists used alliances with thecherokeeandcreekpeoples to secure the raw material at the same time indians took each other as captives and slaves in warfare from 1680 to 1720 approximately 40000 native men women and children were sold through the port principally to thewest indiessuch as bermudaandthe bahamas but also to other southern colonies 29 the lowcountry planters did not keep indian slaves considering them too prone to escape or revolt they used the proceeds of their sale to purchase enslaved black africans for their ownplantations 30 the slave raiding—and the european firearms it introduced—helped destabilizespanish floridaandfrench louisianain the 1700s during thewar of the spanish succession 30 but it also provoked theyamasee warof the 1710s that nearly destroyed the colony after that south carolina largely abandoned the indian slave trade 29 the areas unsuitability for growingtobaccoprompted thelowcountryplantersto experiment with

were sold aboard the arriving ships or at ad hoc gatherings in the towns taverns 32 runaways and minorslave rebellionsprompted the1739 security act which required all white men to carry weapons at all times even to church on sundays before it had fully taken effect the cato orstono rebellionbroke out the white community had recently been decimated by amalariaoutbreak and the rebels killed about 25 white people before being stopped by the colonial militia as a result of their fears of rebellion whites killed a total of 35 to 50 black people 33 34 the planters attributed the violence to recently imported africans and agreed to a 10-year moratorium on slave importation through charlestown they relied for labor upon the slave communities they already held the1740 negro actalso tightened controls requiring a ratio of one white for every ten blacks on any plantation which was often not achieved and banning slaves from assembling together growing their own food earning money or learning to readdrumswere banned because africans used them for signaling slaves were allowed to use string and other instruments 35 when the moratorium expired and charlestown reopened to the slave trade in 1750 the memory of the stono rebellion resulted in traders avoiding buying slaves from thecongoandangola whose populations had a reputation for independence by the mid-18th century charlestown was the hub of the atlantic slave trade in thesouthern colonies even with the decade-long moratorium its customs processed around 40% of the enslaved africans brought to north america between 1700 and 1775 32

from britain on the steps of theexchange slavery was again an important factor in the citys role during therevolutionary war the british attacked the settlement three times 18 assuming that the settlement had a large base ofloyalistswho would rally to their cause once given some military support 39 the loyalty of white southerners towardsthe crownhad largely been forfeited however by british legal cases such as the 1772somersett casewhich marked the prohibition of slavery inengland and wales a significant milestone in theabolitioniststruggle and military tactics such asdunmores

boom at least for the top strata of society the expansion of cotton as a cash crop in the south both led to huge wealth for a small segment of society and funded impressive architecture and culture but also escalated the importance of slaves and led to greater and greater restrictions on black charlestonians by 1783 the growth of the city had reached a point where a municipal government became desirable therefore on august 13 1783 an act of incorporation for the city of charleston was ratified the act originally specified the citys name as charles ton as opposed to the previous charlestown but the spelling charleston quickly came to dominate 41 althoughcolumbiahad replaced it as the state capital in 1788 charleston became even more prosperous aseli whitneys 1793 invention of thecotton ginsped the processing of the crop over 50 timesbritainsindustrial revolution—initially built upon itstextile industry—took up the extra production ravenously and cotton became charlestons major export commodity in the 19th century the bank of south carolina the second-oldest building in the nation to be constructed as a bank was established in 1798 branches of thefirstandsecondbanks of the united states were also located in charleston in 1800 and 1817 throughout theantebellum period charleston continued to be the only major american city with a majority-slave population 42 d the citys widespread use of slaves as workers was a frequent subject of writers and visitors a merchant from liverpool noted in 1834 that almost all the working population are negroes all the servants the carmen & porters all the people who see at the stalls in market and most of the journeymen in trades 43 american traders had beenprohibited from equippingtheatlantic slave tradein 1794 and all importation of slaves was bannedin 1808 but american merchantmen frequently refused to permitbritish inspectionfor enslaved cargo and smuggling remained common much more important was the domestic slave trade which boomed as the deep south developed into new cotton plantations as a result of the trade there was a forced migration of more than one million slaves from the upper south to the lower south in the antebellum years during the early 19th century the first dedicated slave markets were founded in charleston mostly near chalmers and state streets 32 many domestic slavers used charleston as a port in what was called the coastwise trade traveling to such ports as mobile and new orleans slave ownership was the primary marker of class and even the towns freedmen andfree people of colortypically kept slaves if they had the wealth to do so 44 visitors commonly remarked on the sheer number of blacks in charleston and their seeming freedom of movement 45 though in fact—mindful of thestono rebellionand theslave revolutionthat establishedhaiti—the whites closely regulated the behavior of both slaves and free people of color wages and hiring practices were fixed identifying badges were sometimes required and even work songs were sometimes censored 46 punishment was handled out of sight by the citysworkhouse whose fees provided the municipal government with thousands a year 47 in 1820 a state law mandated that each act ofmanumission freeing a slave required legislative approval effectively halting the practice 48 the effects of slavery were pronounced on white society as well the high cost of 19th-century slaves and their high rate of return combined to institute an oligarchic society controlled by about ninety interrelated families where 4% of the free population controlled half of the wealth and the lower half of the free population—unable to compete with owned or rented slaves—held no wealth at all 42 the white middle class was minimal charlestonians generally disparaged hard work as the lot of slaves 49 all the slaveholders taken together held 82% of the citys wealth and almost all non-slaveholders were poor 42 olmstedconsidered their civic elections entirely contests of money and personal influence and the oligarchs dominated civic planning 51 the lack of public parks and amenities was noted as was the abundance of private gardens in the wealthys walled estates 52 in the 1810s the towns churches intensified their discrimination against their black parishioners culminating inbethel methodists 1817 construction of ahearsehouse over its black burial ground 4376 black methodists joinedmorris brownin establishinghampstead church theafrican methodist episcopalchurch now known asmother emanuel 53 54 state and city laws prohibited black literacy limited black worship to daylight hours and required a majority of any churchs parishioners be white in june 1818 140 black church members athampstead churchwere arrested and eight of its leaders given fines and ten lashes police raided the church again in 1820 and pressured it in 1821 54 in 1822 members of the church led bydenmark vesey a lay preacher 54 and carpenter who had bought his freedom after winning a lottery planned an uprising and escape tohaiti—initially forbastille day—that failed when one slave revealed the plot to his master e over the next month the citys intendant mayor james hamilton jrorganized a militia for regular patrols initiated a secret andextrajudicialtribunal to investigate and hanged 35 and exiled 35 54 or 37 slaves tospanish cubafor their involvement 55 hamilton imposed more restrictions on both free and enslaved blacks south carolina required free black sailors to be imprisoned while their ships were in charleston harbor though international treaties eventually required the united states to quash the practice free blacks were banned from returning to the state if they left for any reason 56 slaves were given a 915 pm curfew the city razed hampstead church to the ground 55 56 and erected anew arsenal this structure later was the basis ofthe citadels first campus the ame congregation built a new church but in 1834 the city banned it and all black worship services followingnat turners1831 rebellionin virginia 57 the estimated 10% of slaves who came to america asmuslims 58 never had a separatemosque slaveholders sometimes provided them with beef rations in place of pork in recognition of religious traditions 59 the registeredtonnageof charleston shipping in 1829 was 12410 60 in 1832 south carolina passed an ordinance ofnullification a procedure by which a state could in effect repeal a federal law it was directed against the most recenttariffacts soon federal soldiers were dispensed to charlestons forts and fiveunited states coast guard cutterswere detached to charleston harbor to take possession of any vessel arriving from a foreign port and defend her against any attempt to dispossess the customs officers of her custody until all the requirements of law have been complied with this federal action became known as the charleston incident the states politicians worked on a compromise law in washington to gradually reduce the tariffs 61 charlestons embrace of classical architecture began after a devastating fire leveled much of the city on april 27 1838 charleston suffered a catastrophic fire that burned more than 1000 buildings and caused about $3 million equivalent to $84910000 in 2023 in damage at the time the damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city when the many homes and business were rebuilt or repaired a great cultural awakening occurred previous to the fire only a few homes were styled as greek revival many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration this tradition continued and made charleston one of the foremost places to viewgreek revivalarchitecture thegothic revivalalso made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout european religion 62 by 1840 the market hall and sheds where fresh meat and produce were brought daily became a hub of commercial activity theslave tradealso depended on the port of charleston where ships could be unloaded and the slaves bought and sold the legal importation of african slaves had ended in 1808 although smuggling was significant however the domestic trade was booming more than one million slaves were transported from theupper southto thedeep southin the antebellum years as cotton plantations were widely developed through what became known as theblack belt many slaves were transported in thecoastwise slave trade with slave ships stopping at ports such as charleston ### civil war 1861–1865 charleston played a major part in the civil war as a pivotal city both the union and confederate armies vied for control of it the civil war began incharleston harborin 1861 and ended mere months after the union forces took control of charleston in 1865 followingthe electionofabraham lincoln

11 1861 an enormous fire burned over 500 acres 200 ha of the city union control of the sea permitted the repeated bombardment of the city causing vast damage 63 although admiral du ponts naval assault on the towns forts in april 1863 failed 18 the union navys blockade shut down most commercial traffic over the course of the war someblockade runnersgot through but not a single one made it into or out of the charleston harbor between august 1863 and march 1864 63 the early submarinehl hunleymade a night attack on theusshousatonicon february 17 1864 64 general gillmores land assault in july 1864 was unsuccessful 18 but the fall ofcolumbiaand advance of generalwilliam t shermans army through the state prompted the confederates to evacuate the town on february 17 1865 burning the public buildings cotton warehouses and other sources of supply before their departure 18 union troopsmoved into the city within the month 18 the war department recovered what federal property remained and also confiscated the campus of thecitadel military academyand used it as a federal garrison for the next 17 years the facilities were finally returned to the state and reopened as a military college in 1882 under the direction of lawrence e marichak ### postbellum 1865–1945 after the defeat of the confederacy federal forces remained in charleston duringreconstruction the war had shattered the citys prosperity but the african-american population surged from 17000 in 1860 to over 27000 in 1880 as freedmen moved from the countryside to the major city 65 blacks quickly left thesouthern baptist churchand resumed open meetings of theafrican methodist episcopalandame zionchurches they purchased dogs guns liquor and better clothes—all previously banned—and ceased yielding the sidewalks to whites 65 despite the efforts of the state legislature to haltmanumissions charleston had already had a large class of free people of color as well at the onset of the war the city had 3785 free people of color many of mixed race making up about 18% of the citys black population and 8% of its total population many were educated and practiced skilled crafts 27 they quickly became leaders of south carolinasrepublican partyand its legislators men who had been free people of color before the war comprised 26% of those elected to state and federal office in south carolina from 1868 to 1876 66 67 by the late 1870s industry was bringing the city and its inhabitants back to a renewed vitality new jobs attracted new residents 18 as the citys commerce improved residents worked to restore or create community institutions in 1865 theavery normal institutewas established by theamerican missionary associationas the first free secondary school for charlestons african american population gen sherman lent his support to the conversion of the united states arsenal into the porter military academy an educational facility for former soldiers and boys left orphaned or destitute by the war porter military academy later joined with gaud school and is now auniversity-preparatory schoolporter-gaud school in 1875 blacks made up 57% of the citys and 73% of the countys population 68 with leadership by members of the antebellum free black community historian melinda meeks hennessy described the community as unique in being able to defend themselves without provoking massive white retaliation as occurred in numerous other areas duringreconstruction 68 in the 1876 election cycle two major riots between black republicans and white democrats occurred in the city in september and the day after the election in november as well as a violent incident in cainhoy at an october joint discussion meeting 68 violent incidents occurred throughout the piedmont of the state as white insurgents struggled to maintainwhite supremacyin the face of social changes after the war and granting of citizenship to freedmen by federal constitutional amendments after former confederates were allowed to vote again election campaigns from 1872 on were marked by violent intimidation of blacks and republicans by conservative democraticparamilitarygroups known as thered shirts violent incidents took place in charleston on king street on september 6 and in nearby cainhoy on october 15 both in association with political meetings before the 1876 election the cainhoy incident was the only one statewide in which more whites were killed than blacks 69 the red shirts were instrumental in suppressing the black republican vote in some areas in 1876 and narrowly electingwade hamptonas governor and taking back control of the state legislature another riot occurred in charleston the day after the election when a prominent republican leader was mistakenly reported killed 68 in the early 20th century strong political machines emerged in the city reflecting economic class racial and ethnic tensions the factions nearly all opposed us senatorben tillmanwho repeatedly attacked and ridiculed the city in the name of upstate poor farmers well organized factions within the democratic party in charleston gave the voters clear choices and played a large role in state politics 70 on

following the publication ofalbert simonsandsamuel laphamsarchitecture of charleston 71 in the 1920s 72 thecharleston hospital strikeof 1969 in which mostly black workers protested discrimination and low wages was one of the last major events of thecivil rights movement it attractedralph abernathycoretta scott kingandrew young and other prominent figures to march with the local leader mary

hurricane hugo came ashore at charleston harbor in 1989 and though the worst damage was in nearbymcclellanville three-quarters of the homes in charlestons historic district sustained damage of varying
