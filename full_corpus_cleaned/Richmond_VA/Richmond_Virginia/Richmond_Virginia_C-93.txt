explorers northwest up the james river to an inhabited area in the powhatan nation 17 richmond was arrohattoc territory where arrohateck village was located however as time progressed relations between the arrohattocs and english colonists declined and by 1609 the tribe was unwilling to trade with the settlers as the population began to dwindle the tribe declined and was last mentioned in a 1610 report by the visiting william strachey by 1611 the tribes henrico town was found to be deserted when sir thomas dale went to use the land to found henricus 18 in 1611 the first european settlement in central virginia was established at henricus where the falling creek empties into the james river in 1619 early virginia company settlers established the falling creek ironworks there decades of conflicts between the powhatan and the settlers followed including the battle of bloody run fought near richmond in 1656 after tensions arose from an influx of manahoacs and nahyssans from the north nonetheless the james falls area saw more white settlement in the late 1600s and early 1700s 19 in early 1737 planter william byrd ii commissioned major william mayo to lay out the original town grid completed in april byrd named the city after the english town of richmond near and now part of london because the view of the james rivers bend at the fall line reminded him of his home at richmond hill on the river thames in 1742 the settlement was incorporated as a town 20 21 ## american revolution in 1775 patrick henry delivered his famous give me liberty or give me death! speech in richmonds st johns church greatly influencing virginias participation in the first continental congress and the course of the american revolution 22 on april 18 1780 the state capital was moved from williamsburg to richmond providing a more centralized location for virginias increasing western population and theoretically isolating the capital from a british attack from the coast 23 in 1781 loyalist troops led by benedict arnold led a raid on richmond and burnt it leading governor thomas jefferson to flee while the virginia militia led by sampson mathews unsuccessfully defended the city 24 ## early united states richmond recovered quickly from the war thriving within a year of its burning 25 in 1786 the virginia statute for religious freedom drafted by thomas jefferson was enacted separating church and state and advancing the legal principle for freedom of religion in the united states 26 in 1788 the virginia state capitol designed by jefferson and charles-louis clérisseau in the greek revival style was completed to bypass richmonds rapids on the upper james river and provide a water route across the appalachian mountains to the kanawha river which flows westward into the ohio river and converges with the mississippi river george washington helped design the james river and kanawha canal 27 the canal started in westham and cut east to richmond facilitating the transfer of cargo from flat-bottomed james river bateaux above the fall line to the ocean-faring ships below 27 the canal boatmen legacy is represented by the figure in the center of the city flag 28 because of the canal and the hydropower the falls generated richmond emerged as an important industrial center after the american revolutionary war 1775–1783 it became home to some of the largest manufacturing facilities including iron works and flour mills in the south and the country by 1850 richmond was connected by the richmond and petersburg railroad to port walthall where ships carrying over 200 tons of cargo could connect to baltimore or philadelphia passenger liners could reach norfolk virginia through the hampton roads harbor 29 in the 19th century richmond was connected to the north by the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad later replaced by csxt the railroad also was used by some to escape slavery in the mid-19th century in 1849 henry box brown had himself nailed into a small box and shipped from richmond to abolitionists in philadelphia through baltimore s president street station on the philadelphia wilmington and baltimore railroad often used by the underground railroad to assist escaping disguised slaves reach the free state of pennsylvania 30 ## american civil war five days after the confederate attack on fort sumter the virginia legislature voted to secede from the united states and join the newly created confederate states of america on april 17 1861 the action became official in may after the confederacy promised to move its national capital to richmond from montgomery alabama richmond held local state and national confederate government offices hospitals a railroad hub and one of the largest slave markets it also had the largest confederate arms factory the tredegar iron works the factory produced artillery and other munitions including heavy ordnance machinery and the 723 tons of armor plating that covered the css virginia the worlds first ironclad ship used in war 31 the confederate states congress shared quarters in the jefferson-designed virginia state capitol with the virginia general assembly the confederacys executive mansion known as the white house of the confederacy was two blocks away on clay street located about 100 mi 160 km from the national capital in washington dc richmond was at the end of a long supply line and difficult to defend for four years its defense required the bulk of the army of northern virginia and the confederacys best troops and commanders 32 the union army made richmond a main target in the campaigns of 1862 and 1864–65 in late june and early july 1862 union general-in-chief george b mcclellan threatened but failed to take richmond in the seven days battles of the peninsula campaign three years later richmond became indefensible in march 1865 after nearby petersburg fell and several remaining rail supply lines to the south and southwest were broken on march 25 confederate general john b gordon s desperate attack on fort stedman east of petersburg failed on april 1 union cavalry general philip sheridan assigned to interdict the southside railroad met brigades commanded by southern general george pickett at the five forks junction defeated them took thousands of prisoners and advised union general-in-chief ulysses s grant to order a general advance when the union sixth corps broke through confederate lines on the boydton plank road south of petersburg confederate casualties exceeded 5000 about a tenth of lees defending army lee then informed president jefferson davis that he intended to evacuate richmond 33 on april 2 1865 the confederate army began richmonds evacuation confederate president davis and his cabinet confederate government archives and its treasurys gold left the city that night by train confederate officials burned documents and troops burned tobacco and other warehouses to deny the union any spoils in the early morning of april 3 confederate troops exploded the citys gunpowder magazine killing several paupers in a temporary almshouse and a man on 2nd st the concussion shattered windows all over the city 34 later that day general godfrey weitzel commander of the 25th corps of the united states colored troops accepted richmonds surrender from the mayor and a group of leading citizens who did not evacuate 35 36 union troops eventually contained the fires but about 25% of the citys buildings were destroyed 37 on april 3 president abraham lincoln visited grant at petersburg and took a launch up the james river to richmond on april 4 while davis attempted to organize the confederate government in danville lincoln met confederate assistant secretary of war john a campbell handing him a note inviting virginias state legislature to end their rebellion after campbell spun the note to confederate legislators as a possible end to the emancipation proclamation lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered general weitzel to prevent the state legislature from meeting on april 6 union forces killed wounded or captured 8000 confederate troops at saylers creek southwest of petersburg the confederate army continued a general retreat southwestward and general lee continued to reject general grants surrender entreaties until sheridans infantry and cavalry encircled the shrinking army of northern virginia and cut off its ability to retreat further on april 8 lee surrendered his remaining approximately 10000 troops the following morning at appomattox court house meeting grant at the mclean home 38 davis was captured on may 10 near irwinville georgia and taken back to virginia where he was imprisoned two years at fort monroe until freed on bail 39 ## postbellum a decade after the civil war richmond resumed its position as a major urban center of economic productivity with iron front buildings and massive brick factories canal traffic peaked in the 1860s with railroads becoming the dominant shipping method richmond became a major railroad crossroads 40 showcasing the worlds first triple railroad crossing tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a central economic role advanced by the worlds first cigarette-rolling machine that james albert bonsack of roanoke invented between 1880 and 1881 lewis ginter was the founder of allen & ginter which was at the time one of the worlds largest tobacco companies he would devote his philanthropy to richmond and was quoted saying i am for richmond first and last he built the jefferson hotel and suburbs north of richmond which would go on to be the model for much of the country 41 another important contributor to richmonds resurgence was the richmond union passenger railway a trolley system developed by electric power pioneer frank j sprague the system opened its first richmond line in 1888 using an overhead wire and a trolley pole to connect to the current and electric motors on the cars trucks 42 the success led to electric streetcar lines rapidly spreading to other cities 43 a post-world war ii transition to buses from streetcars began in may 1947 and was completed on november 25 1949 44 ## 20th century by the beginning of the 20th century the citys population had reached 85050 in 5 sq mi 13 km 2 making it the most densely populated city in the southern united states 45 in the 1900 census richmonds population was 62.1% white and 37.9% black 46 freed slaves and their descendants created a thriving african-american business community and the citys historic jackson ward became known as the wall street of black america in 1903 african-american businesswoman and financier maggie l walker chartered st luke penny savings bank served as its president and was the first black female bank president in the united states 47 charles thaddeus russell was richmonds first black architect and he designed the banks office 48 today the bank is called the consolidated bank and trust company and is the countrys oldest surviving african-american bank 47 another prominent african-american from this time was john mitchell jr a newspaper editor civil rights activist and politician in 1910 the former city of manchester consolidated with richmond and in 1914 the city annexed barton heights ginter park and highland park in henrico county 49 in may 1914 richmond became the headquarters of the fifth district of the federal reserve bank several major performing arts venues were constructed during the 1920s including what are now the landmark theatre byrd theatre and carpenter theatre the citys first radio station wrva began broadcasting in 1925 wtvr-tv cbs 6 richmonds first television station was also the first tv station south of washington dc 50 between 1963 and 1965 there was a downtown boom that led to the construction of more than 700 buildings in 1968 virginia commonwealth university was created by the merger of the medical college of virginia and the richmond professional institute 51 on january 1 1970 richmonds borders expanded south by 27 sq mi 70 km 2 and its population increased by 47000 after several years of court cases in which chesterfield county unsuccessfully fought annexation 52 in 1995 a multimillion-dollar flood wall was completed protecting the citys low-lying areas from the oft-rising james river consequently the river district businesses grew rapidly bolstered by the creation of a canal walk along the citys former industrial canals 53 54 today the area is home to much of richmonds entertainment dining and nightlife activity in 1996 racial tensions grew amid controversy about adding the statue of african american richmond native and tennis star arthur ashe to the series of statues of confederate figures on monument avenue 55 after several months of controversy ashes bronze statue was finally completed on july 10 1996 56 ## 21st century by the beginning of the 21st century the population of the greater richmond metropolitan area had reached approximately 1100000 although the population of the city itself had declined to less than 200000 on november 2 2004 former virginia governor l douglas wilder was elected as the citys first directly elected mayor in over 60 years 57 most of the statues honoring confederate leaders such as the robert e lee monument on monument avenue were removed during or after the george floyd protests in june 2020 following the killing of george floyd by minneapolis police officer derek m chauvin the city removed the last confederate statue honoring confederate general general a p hill on december 12 2022 the only statue remaining on monument avenue is of arthur ashe the pioneering black tennis player the bill bojangles robinson monument in jackson ward was untouched during the protests and remained in

climate with hot humid summers and moderately cold winters 64 65 the mountains to the west act as a partial barrier to outbreaks of cold continental air in winter arctic air is delayed long enough to be modified and further warmed as it subsides in its approach to richmond the open waters of the chesapeake bay and atlantic ocean contribute to the humid summers and cool winters the coldest weather
