golden city was established on june 16 1859 along clear creek west of denver the city is named after thomas l golden other important businessmen and prospectors like william ah loveland and george west were among the first people to settle in golden 8 by the end of 1860 golden city had been popularly elected the seat of jefferson county and was capital of the provisional jefferson territory as drafted in the territorial constitution the capital of the jefferson territory was initially proposed to be golden then with a population of 700 as a result of its proximity to mountain mining towns and greater ability to hold a congressional quorum than had denver 9 golden city was temporarily removed from the status of territory capital as a result of an act passed on november 5 1861 by the territorial government colorado city a small town to the south of denver became the new temporary territorial capital but saw only one short event at this location this status was quickly revoked however as on august 4 1862 the territorial government voted formally to move back to golden 10 while the town lost much of its populace and leading citizenry during the civil war for several reasons ranging from military to economic golden city became capital of the federally recognized colorado territory on august 2 1862 continuing as such until 1867 11 it was during the time period between 1862 and the early 1870s that a fierce railroad competition developed between denver ten miles 16 km to the east and golden by the mid-1860s golden held only an honorific status as territorial capital rather than serving as the legitimate source of territorial power denver the increasingly larger and more developed city was the focused core of important territorial occasions with the governor residing in denver and territorial government meetings occurring there as well the citizens and supporters of golden realized that a spur from golden to the new transcontinental railroad running through cheyenne wyoming 100 miles 160 km to the north was the only possibility for golden to reemerge as the dominant heart of commerce in the territory wah loveland founded the colorado central railroad on february 9 1865 to do just this 8 with golden beginning talk of creating a railroad prominent denver residents raced to do the same in an appeal to the residents of denver the rocky mountain news which was based in denver itself wrote an article imploring the citizens of denver to vote to fund a railroad if we vote $500000 in bonds to the denver pacific railway all is well if we defeat those bonds all hope of a railroad for the next two years is gone gentlemen of denver what will you do? the fate of your city is in your own hands 12 the residents of denver voted for the bonds spurring construction of the denver pacific railway by 1869 the railroad race to cheyenne was becoming less and less of a race as the denver pacific railway pulled ahead of the struggling colorado central railroad realizing they were going to lose the race to cheyenne the colorado central began expanding west into mountain communities such as georgetown black hawk and central city all areas founded on and focused in silver mining 13 golden having then sidetracked into servicing various close by mountain communities continued to fall behind the pace set by the denver railroad and by 1870 officially lost the race to cheyenne however the colorado central railroad connected directly with cheyenne seven years later in 1877 but by that point the race with denver had been lost 9 although goldens colorado central railroad offered a challenge to denvers railroad the better funded denver pacific railway was able to connect to cheyenne far more quickly than golden securing for denver its long term status as both capital and prominent city the denver tramway at golden depot 1909 golden city became the lowell of the west a regional center of trade and industry that boasted at certain
