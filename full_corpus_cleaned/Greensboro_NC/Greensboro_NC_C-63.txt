disenfranchised under state laws jim crow laws and customs were in effect and public facilities including schools were racially segregated by law this was after the us supreme courts 1954 ruling in brown v board of education that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional facilities reserved for blacks were generally underfunded by the state and city governments which were dominated by conservative white democrats in the postwar period blacks in north carolina and across the south pushed to regain their constitutional rights college students from north carolina agricultural and technical college a&t a historically black college made greensboro a center of protests and change on february 1 1960 four black college students sat down at an all-white woolworths lunch counter and refused to leave after they were denied service they had already purchased items in other parts of the store and kept their receipts after being denied lunch service they brought out the receipts asking why their money was good everywhere else in the store but not at the lunch counter 40 hundreds of supporters soon joined in this sit-in which lasted several months such protests quickly spread across the south ultimately leading to the desegregation of lunch counters and other facilities at woolworths and other chains woolworths went out of business due to changes in 20th-century retail practices but the original woolworths lunch counter and stools are still in their original location the former woolworths building has been adapted as the international civil rights center and museum

store now the international civil rights center and museum the white business community acceded to the desegregation of woolworths and made other minor concessions but the civil rights movement had additional goals holding protests in 1962 and 1963 in may and june 1963 the largest civil rights protest in north carolina history took place in greensboro protesters sought desegregation of public accommodations and economic and social justice such as hiring policies based on merit rather than race they also worked for the overdue integration of public schools each night more than 2000 protesters marched through greensboros segregated central business district william thomas and a knighton stanley coordinators of greensboros local core chapter invited jesse jackson then an activist student at a&t to join the protests jackson quickly rose to prominence as a student leader becoming the public spokesman of the non-violent protest movement seeking to overwhelm city jails as was done in protests led by martin luther king jr in birmingham alabama the protesters invited arrest by violating segregation rules of local businesses they were charged with trespassing and other nonviolent actions college and high school students constituted most of the protesters and at one point approximately 1400 blacks were jailed in greensboro the scale of protests disrupted the business community and challenged the leadership of the mayor and governor terry sanford finally the city and business community responded with further desegregation of public facilities reformed hiring policies in city government and commitments to progress by both sanford and greensboros mayor sanford declared anyone who hasnt received this message doesnt understand human nature significant changes in race relations still came at a painfully slow pace and the verbal commitments from white leadership in 1963 were not implemented in substantial ways 43 dudley high school a&t protests edit main article

grew larger and the governor ordered the national guard to back up local police after there were exchanges of gunfire the governor ordered the north carolina national guard into the a&t campus in what was described at the time as the most massive armed assault ever made against an american university 48 the north carolina national guard swept the college dormitories taking hundreds of students into protective custody the demonstrations were suppressed the north carolina state advisory committee to the united states commission on civil rights investigated the disturbances its 1970 report concluded that the national guard invasion was a reckless action disproportionate to the danger posed by student protests it criticized local community leaders for failing to respond adequately to the dudley high school students when the issues first arose they declared it a sad commentary that the only group in the community who would take the dudley students seriously were the students at a&t
