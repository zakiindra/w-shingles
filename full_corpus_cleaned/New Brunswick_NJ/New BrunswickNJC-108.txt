indigenous societies and european explorations pre-1604 paleo-indiansare believed to have been the first humans on the land of new brunswick settling there roughly 10000 years ago 22 because their descendants did not leave a written record there is a lack of knowledge of the history of the area before the arrival of european explorers at the time of european contact inhabitants were themicmacof

inmiscouand explored the coasts ofchaleur bay they made contact with aboriginals who from this point on began to trade with europeans this also exposed them toold worlddiseases 23 ### acadia and nova scotia 1604–1784 acadia a colonial division ofnew francecovering themaritimes was founded in 1604 bysamuel de champlainandpierre dugua de monswith a settlement onsaint croix island it was quickly abandoned due to difficult living conditions and moved to acadias capitalport-royal there the micmacs helped the french survive in 1626 port-royal was destroyed by the british the british conquered acadia shortly after and held it until 1629james vi and i king of scotland renamed it nova scotia in english the micmacs helped all french survivors includingcharles de saint-étienne de la tour together they established afur tradenetwork along thesaint john river with the onset of theanglo-french war 1627–1629 de la tour was issued a charter to govern acadia in 1629 acadia was officially returned to france as such a new wave of french settlers arrived in port-royal to revitalise the colony includingisaac de razilly a newgovernor of acadia andcharles de menou daulnay his cousin de razilly and de la tours charters conflicted with each others but the two maintained an amicable relationship in 1635 de razilly died triggering tensions between de la tour who governed from the saint john valley and daulnay who governed from port-royal in the 1630s this erupted into theacadian civil war daulnay managed to expel de la tour in 1644 but following daulnays death in 1650 de la tour married his widow in 1653 essentially overturning his success over time french settlement extended up the river to the site of present-dayfredericton other settlements in the southeast extended frombeaubassin near the present-day border with nova scotia tobaie verte and up thepetitcodiacmemramcook andshepodyrivers 24 the descendants of acadias french colonists became theacadians acadians developed a unique society characterised by dyking technology which allowed them to cultivate marshes left by thebay of fundys tides and by tightly knit independent communities because they were often neglected by french authorities 25 during the 1690s inking williams war attacks were launched from the saint john valley byacadian militiasonto new england colonists this would create a deep english hostility against the french presence in the region from the 1600s to mid-1700s acadia was routinely a war zone between the french and the english and would often change hands however acadia would definitively fall into british hands followingqueen annes war a conquest of most of the acadian peninsula formalized by thetreaty of utrecht of 1713 after the war acadia was reduced to île saint-jean prince edward island andîle-royale cape breton island with the ownership of continental acadia new brunswick being disputed between france and britain with an informal border on theisthmus of chignecto in an effort to limit british expansion into continental acadia the french builtfort beauséjourat the isthmus in 1751 from 1749 to 1755father le loutres wartook place where british soldiers fought against acadians and micmacs to consolidate their power over acadia nova scotia in 1755 the britishcaptured fort beauséjour severing the acadian supply lines to nova scotia and île-royale continental acadia thus came to be incorporated into the british colony of nova scotia with thetreaty of parisin 1763 following this the british unsatisfied with the acadians surrender because they refused to pledge allegiance turned to capturing and exporting acadians en masse anethnic cleansingevent known as thedeportation of the acadianswhich was ordered byrobert monckton from 1755 to 1763 12000 acadians out of 18000 were forcefully deported to various locations around the world though 8000 died before arrival the remaining 6000 acadians escaped the british by fleeing north to the presentacadia or tocanada 26 from 1755 to 1757 most acadians were deported to thethirteen colonies from 1758 to 1762 most were sent to france between 1763 and 1785 many deported acadians relocated to join their compatriots inlouisiana their descendants becamecajuns in the 1780s and 1790s some acadians returned to acadia and discovered several thousand english immigrants mostly from new england on their former lands 27 28 in the late 1700s the british began to make efforts to colonise the region mostly by importing colonists from new england before the american revolution these colonists were calledplanters after the revolution the colonists were calledloyalists because only those loyal to the british crown settled in nova scotia in 1766 planters from pennsylvania foundedmoncton and english settlers fromyorkshirearrived in thesackvillearea in the 1770s 10000 loyalists settled along the north shore of the bay of fundy 29 in 1783 bothsaint andrewsandsaint johnwere founded ### british colony of new brunswick 1784–1866 loyalists who received land allocations around the st john river valley the bay of fundy or the northumberland strait became dissatisfied with being governed fromhalifaxbecause it was so far away so on 18 june 1784 the british government created a new province for them new brunswick new brunswick was formed from the partition ofsunbury countyfrom the remainder of nova scotia 30 in that same year new brunswick formed its first elected assembly 31 the first governor wasthomas carleton and in 1785 he chose thehamletof sainte-anne as the provincial capital sainte-anne was later renamed fredericks town and then laterfredericton after the third son ofgeorge iii 32 in total it is believed that around 14000 loyalist refugees came to new brunswick however 10% eventually returned to the united states 33 in 1785 saint john became new brunswicks first incorporated city 34 economically new brunswick was a poor environment for agriculture and mining its fishery was also far inferior to that of nova scotias new brunswicks forests were rich in wood but as wood is a bulky and low-value commodity accessible markets were limited essentially in the late 1700s new brunswick was a peripheral corner of the british empire and north american world geopolitical events in europe would change this situation in 1806napoleon bonapartescontinental blockadeforced the united kingdom which usually relied on thebaltic seafor supplies to import timber from its north american colonies this stimulated the lumber trade in new brunswick as well as inlower canada 35 between 1805 and 1812 new brunswick annually exported 100000 tons of squared timber in 1819 the number exceeded 240000 tons and in 1825 exports reached their highest level at 417000 tons 34 this also resulted in the emergence of a shipbuilding market these industries were then bolstered by thecanadian–american reciprocity treatyof 1854 and demand from theamerican civil warof 1861 to 1865st martinsbecame the third most productive shipbuilding town in the maritimes and produced over 500 vessels 36 from 1800 to 1851 new brunswicks population grew from 25000 to 200000 and it saw large-scale immigration from ireland and scotland 37 in 1848 responsible home government was granted 31 the 1850s saw the emergence of political parties largely organised along religious and ethnic lines 34 from the late 1700s to mid 1800sacadiansbecame a minority and they lived largely on the fringes of society fearful of the english they were mostly illiterate due to laws preventing them from opening schools 38 they were also not part of the economic boom and had troubles asserting their land rights 39 during the 1860s the notion of unifying the maritime colonies of british north america was being increasingly discussed this was due to multiple factors for example some felt that the american civil war was the result of a weak central government and wished to avoid the same fate 40 some also wanted to increase trade between the colonies and be less economically tied to the us in 1864 thecharlottetown conferencewas held to discuss a possiblemaritime unionbetweennova scotia new brunswick andprince edward island however theprovince of canada caught wind of the conference and decided to send representatives to attend they asked that the agenda be expanded to discuss a union that would also include them in 1866 the united states cancelled the reciprocity treaty leading to a loss of trade and a stronger desire to build up trade within british north america 41 afenian raidin 1866 also increased public support for a potential union 42 ### canadian province 1867–present on 1 july 1867 new brunswick joined with nova scotia and theprovince of canada now ontario and quebec to create the dominion of canada though confederation brought into existence theintercolonial railwayin 1872 new barriers undermined traditional trade relations in 1879john a macdonaldsconservativesenacted thenational policy which called for high tariffs and opposedfree trade disrupting the trading relationship between the maritimes andnew england the economic situation was worsened by thegreat fire of saint johnof 1877 the decline of the shipbuilding industry and the uspanic of 1893 many experienced workers lost their jobs and had to move west or to the united states in 1871 the government introduced free education banningcatechism thecassockand french in public schools in the process though contested by the acadians and the irish the law was deemed constitutional following a riot incaraquetin 1875 and political pressure the bans were lifted in 1877 43 theirving group of companies founded by theirving family officially began in 1881 inbouctouchewhen james irving bought a sawmill 44 afterwars the family continued to acquire businesses and substantial wealth eventually becoming the richest family in the province today irving is considered by many to exert a monopoly over new brunswick 45 46 47 towards the early 20th century the economy began to improve somewhat the railways and tariffs fostered the growth of new industries in the province such as textile manufacturing iron millspulp and paper mills and sugar refineries 27 however many of these eventually failed to compete with their competition in central canada unemployement was high for a long time and increased during thegreat depressionof the 1930s by the end of the great depression the new brunswick standard of living was much lower than the canadian average in 1937 new brunswick had the highest infant mortality and illiteracy rates in canada 48 in 1940 therowell–sirois commissionreported grave flaws in the canadian constitution while the federal government had most of the revenue gathering powers the provinces had many expenditure responsibilities such as healthcare education and welfare which were becoming increasingly expensive the commission recommended the creation ofequalization payments which were eventually implemented in 1957 after canada joinedworld war ii 14 nb army units were organized in addition tothe royal new brunswick regiment 49 and first deployed in theitalian campaignin 1943 after thenormandy landingsthey redeployed to northwestern europe along withthe north shore regiment 49 thebritish commonwealth air training plan a training program for ally pilots established bases in monctonchatham andpennfield ridge as well as a military typing school in saint john while relatively unindustrialized before the war new brunswick became home to 34 plants on military contracts from which the province received over $78 million 49 prime minister william lyon mackenzie king who had promised no conscription asked the provinces if they would release the government of said promise new brunswick voted 69.1% yes the policy was not implemented until 1944 too late for many of the conscripts to be deployed 49 there were 1808 nb fatalities among the armed forces 50 the acadians in northern new brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous english speakers to the south the population of french origin grew dramatically after confederation from about 16 per cent in 1871 to 34 per cent in 1931 51 government services were often not available in french and the infrastructure in francophone areas was less developed than elsewhere in 1960 premierlouis robichaudembarked on thenew brunswick equal opportunity program in which education rural road maintenance and healthcare fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province rather than the former county-based system in 1969 the robichaud government adopted the official languages act making the province officially bilingual and establishing the right of new brunswickers to obtain provincial government services in the official language of their choice in 1982 at the request of the government ofrichard hatfield this right became part of thecanadian charter of rights and freedomsand therefore part of theconstitution of canada 12 theflag of new brunswick based on the coat of arms was adopted in 1965 the conventional heraldic representations of a lion and a ship represent colonial ties with europe and the importance of shipping at the time the coat of arms was assigned 52 in 2005 the court of queens benchapproved a rulingallowing for the legalization ofsame-sex marriage 53 at the beginning of 2023 the provincial government implemented alocal governance reform reducing the number of entities from 340 to 89 54 ### geography roughly square new brunswick is bordered on the north by quebec on the east by the atlantic ocean on the south by the bay of fundy and on the west by the us state ofmaine the southeast corner of the province is connected to nova scotia at theisthmusof chignecto glaciation has left much of new brunswicks uplands with only shallow acidic soils which have discouraged settlement but which are home to enormous forests 55 ### climate new brunswicks climate is more severe than that of the other maritime provinces which are lower and have more shoreline along the moderating sea new brunswick has ahumid continental climate with slightly milder winters on the gulf of st lawrence coastline elevated parts of the far north of the province have asubarctic climate evidence ofclimate changein new brunswick can be seen in its more intense precipitation events more frequent winterthaws and one quarter to half the amount ofsnowpack 56 today the sea level is about 30 cm 1 ft higher than it was 100 years ago and it is expected to rise twice that much again by the year 2100 56 ### flora and fauna most of new brunswick 57 is forested withsecondary forestor tertiary forest at the start of european settlement the maritimes were covered from coast to coast by a forest of mature trees giants by todays standards today less than one per cent of old-growthacadian forestremains 58 and theworld wide fund for naturelists the acadian forest as endangered 59 following the frequent large scale disturbances caused by settlement and timber harvesting the acadian forest is not growing back as it was but is subject to borealization this means that exposure-resistant species that are well adapted to the frequent large-scale disturbances common in the boreal forest are increasingly abundant these includejack pinebalsam firblack sprucewhite birch andpoplar 59 forest ecosystems support

ofglyphosatemay have contributed to this 62 since 2014 the new brunswick government has allowed forestry companies to harvest 20 percent more wood there than before 62 ### geology bedrock types range from 1 billion to 200 million years old 63 much of the bedrock in the west and north derives from ocean deposits in theordovicianthat were subject tofoldingandigneousintrusionand that were eventually covered with lava during thepaleozoic peaking during theacadian orogeny 27 during thecarboniferousperiod about 340 million years ago new brunswick was in themaritimes basin asedimentary basinnear the

2024 the population is estimated to be 854355 67 the atlantic provinces also have higher rural populations new brunswick was largely rural until 1951 since then the rural-urban split has been roughly even 68 population density in the maritimes is above average among canadian provinces this reflects their small size and the fact that they do not possess large unpopulated hinterlands like the other seven provinces and three territories new brunswicks 107 municipalities 69 cover8.6% of the provinces land mass but are home to65.3% of its population the three major urban areas are in the south of the province and aregreater moncton population 157717greater saint john population 130613 andgreater fredericton population 108610 ### ethnicity in the 2001 census the most commonly reported

large portion of the economy is controlled by theirving group of companies which consists of the holdings of the family ofk c irving the companies have significant holdings in agricultureforestryfood processingfreight transport including railways and trucking mediaoil andshipbuilding 77 the influence of the irving family on new brunswick is such that the province is sometimes described as being subject to a form of economicfeudalism in 2016 the 200 or so companies it controls gave it about $10 billion in capital 78 79 the groups activities are supported by the authorities through numerous tax exemptions and the payment of subsidies notably through the renewable energy purchase program for large industry the province has also progressively handed over the management of the public sector forestry assets to the irving group regularly lowering standards in 2014 the latter reduced the size of buffer zones between forests and human settlements allowed moreclear-cutting increased the planned production volume and reduced the proportion of protected areas from 31% to 22% 78 79 throughacadia broadcastingthe family owns several local radio stations the family owned all the provinces english-language newspapers throughbrunswick newsuntil its sale topostmediain 2022 80 for academicalain deneault the conflicts of interest that arise from this situation seem caricatural the groups media essentially echo the positions of the irving family in all the fields of social and industrial life in which it is involved the information transmitted by the group and disseminated by the press is sometimes questioned notably in the fall of 2018 during an explosion at the saint john refinery but few public officials professors and members of parliament carry denunciations as the familys financial contributions to universities and political parties provide it with leverage 78 79 the united states is the provinces largest export market accounting for 92% of a foreign trade valued in 2014 at almost $13 billion with refined petroleum making up 63% of that followed by seafood products pulp paper and sawmill products and non-metallic minerals chiefly potash the value of exports mostly to the united states was $1.6 billion in 2016 about half of that came from lobster other products include salmon crab and herring 81 in 2015 spending on non-residenttourism in new brunswickwas $441 million which provided $87 million in tax revenue 82 biologists academics andeilish cleary the provinces former head of public health have reported being subjected to intense pressure including dismissal in clearys case while analyzing the impact of the companys pesticides and its opaque forest management since the 1970s every premier in the province has been elected with the support of irvingblaine higgs premier since november 2018 is a former executive of the group according to journalistmichel cormier we might be able to win an election without irvings tacit support but we could hardly aspire to power if he decided to openly oppose it 78 79 ### primary sector a large number of residents from new brunswick are employed in theprimary sector of industry more than 13000 new brunswickers work in agriculture shipping products worth over $1 billion half of which is from crops and half of that from potatoes mostly in the saint john river valleymccain foodsis one of the worlds largest manufacturers of frozen potato products other products include applescranberries andmaple syrup 83 new brunswick was in 2015 the biggest producer of wildblueberriesin canada 84 the value of the livestock sector is about a quarter of a billion dollars nearly half of which is dairy other sectors include poultry fur and goats sheep and pigs about 85 to 90% of new brunswick is forested historically important it accounted for more than 80% of exports in the mid-1800s by the end of the 1800s the industry and shipbuilding were declining due to external economic factors the 1920s saw the development of a pulp and paper industry in the mid-1960s forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests 51 the industry employs nearly 12000 generating revenues around $437 million 27 mining was historically unimportant in the province but has grown since the 1950s 85 the provinces gdp from the mining and quarrying industry in 2015 was $299.5 million 86 mines in new brunswickproduce lead zinc copper and potash forest management in the province is particularly opaque donald bowser an international expert on political
