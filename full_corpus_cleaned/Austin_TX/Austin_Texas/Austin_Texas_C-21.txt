history of activism and progressive politics focused on environmental and civic reform and is ranked among the safest large cities in the united states since the late 19th century austin has also been

austin has become a center for technology and business 22 23 the technology roots in austin can be traced back to the 1960s when defense electronics contractor tracor now bae systems began operations in the city in 1962 ibm followed in 1967 opening a facility to produce its selectric typewriters texas instruments was set up in austin two years later and motorola now nxp semiconductors started

history austin travis county and williamson county have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 bc the areas earliest known inhabitants lived during the late pleistocene ice age and are linked to the clovis culture around 9200 bc over 11200 years ago based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the much-studied gault site midway between georgetown and fort cavazos 25 26 failed verification when settlers arrived from europe the tonkawa tribe inhabited the area the comanches and lipan apaches were also known to travel through the area 27 spanish colonists including the espinosa - olivares - aguirre expedition traveled through the area though few permanent settlements were created for some time 28 in 1730 three catholic missions from east texas were combined and reestablished as one mission on the south side of the colorado river in what is now zilker park in austin the mission was in this area for only about seven months then was moved to san antonio de béxar and split into three missions 29 during the 1830s pioneers began to settle the area in central austin along the colorado river spanish forts were established in what are now bastrop and san marcos 28 30 following mexicos independence new settlements were established in central texas 30 31 32 in 1835–1836 texans fought and won independence from mexico texas thus became an independent country with its own president congress and monetary system in 1839 the texas congress formed a commission to seek a site for the new capital of the republic of texas to replace houston 33 when he was vice president of texas mirabeau b lamar had visited the area during a buffalo -hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838 he advised the commissioners to consider the area on the north bank of the colorado river near the present-day congress avenue bridge noting the areas hills waterways and pleasant surroundings 34 it was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between santa fe and galveston bay as well as routes between northern mexico and the red river 35 in 1839 the site was chosen and briefly incorporated under the name waterloo 36 shortly afterward the name was changed to austin in honor of stephen f austin the father of texas and the republics first secretary of state the city grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the texas state capitol and the university of texas at austin 37 edwin waller was picked by lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital 33 the original site was narrowed to 640 acres 260 ha that fronted the colorado river between two creeks shoal creek and waller creek which was later named in his honor waller and a team of surveyors developed austins first city plan commonly known as the waller plan dividing the site into a 14-block grid plan bisected by a broad north–south thoroughfare congress avenue running up from the river to capital square where the new texas state capitol was to be constructed a temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of colorado and 8th streets on august 1 1839 the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held 33 35 the waller plan designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown austin in 1840 a series of conflicts between the texas rangers and the comanches known as the council house fight and the battle of plum creek pushed the comanches westward mostly ending conflicts in central texas 38 settlement in the area began to expand quickly travis county was established in 1840 and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades 32 initially the new capital thrived but lamars political enemy sam houston used two mexican army incursions to san antonio as an excuse to move the government sam houston fought bitterly against lamars decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness the men and women who traveled mainly from houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well by 1840 the population had risen to 856 nearly half of whom fled austin when congress recessed 39 the resident african american population listed in january of this same year was 176 40 the fear of austins proximity to the indians and mexico which still considered texas a part of their land created an immense motive for sam houston the first and third president of the republic of texas to relocate the capital once again in 1841 upon threats of mexican troops in texas houston raided the land office to transfer all official documents to houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the archive war but the people of austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed the documents stayed but the capital would temporarily move from austin to houston to washington-on-the-brazos without the governmental body austins population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s the voting by the fourth president of the republic anson jones and congress who reconvened in austin in 1845 settled the issue to keep austin the seat of government as well as annex the republic of texas into the united states in 1860 38% of travis county residents were slaves 41 in 1861 with the outbreak of the american civil war voters in austin and other central texas communities voted against secession 30 33 however as the war progressed and fears of attack by union forces increased austin contributed hundreds of men to the confederate forces the african american population of austin swelled dramatically after the enforcement of the emancipation proclamation in texas by union general gordon granger at galveston in an event commemorated as juneteenth black communities such as wheatville pleasant hill and clarksville were established with clarksville being the oldest surviving freedomtown ‒ the original post-civil war settlements founded by former african-american slaves ‒ west of the mississippi river 33 in 1870 blacks made up 36.5% of austins population 42 the postwar period saw dramatic population and economic growth the opening of the houston and texas central railway h&tc in 1871 43 turned austin into the major trading center for the region with the ability to transport both cotton and cattle the missouri kansas & texas mkt line followed close behind 44 austin was also the terminus of the southernmost leg of the chisholm trail and drovers pushed cattle north to the railroad 45 cotton was one of the few crops produced locally for export and a cotton gin engine was located downtown near the trains for ginning cotton of its seeds and turning the product into bales for shipment 46 however as other new railroads were built through the region in the 1870s austin began to lose its primacy in trade to the surrounding communities 33 in addition the areas east of austin took over cattle and cotton production from austin especially in towns like hutto and taylor that sit over the blackland prairie with its deep rich soils for producing cotton and hay 47 48 in september 1881 austin public schools held their first classes the same year tillotson collegiate and normal institute now part of huston–tillotson university opened its doors the university of texas held its first classes in 1883 although classes had been held in the original wooden state capitol for four years before 49 during the 1880s austin gained new prominence as the state capitol building was completed in 1888 and claimed as the seventh largest building in the world 33 in the late 19th century austin expanded its city limits to more than three times its former area and the first granite dam was built on the colorado river to power a new street car line and the new moon towers 33 the first dam washed away in a flood on april 7 1900 50 in the late 1920s and 1930s austin implemented the 1928 austin city plan through a series of civic development and beautification projects that created much of the citys infrastructure and many of its parks in addition the state legislature established the lower colorado river authority lcra that along with the city of austin created the system of dams along the colorado river to form the highland lakes these projects were enabled in large part because the public works administration provided austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other texas cities 33 during the early 20th century a three-way system of social segregation emerged in austin with anglos african americans and mexicans being separated by custom or law in most aspects of life including housing health care and education deed restrictions also played an important role in residential segregation after 1935 most housing deeds prohibited african americans and sometimes other nonwhite groups from using land 51 combined with the system of segregated public services racial segregation increased in austin during the first half of the twentieth century with african americans and mexicans experiencing high levels of discrimination and social marginalization 52 in 1940 the destroyed granite dam on the colorado river was finally replaced by a hollow concrete dam 53 that formed lake mcdonald now called lake austin and which has withstood all floods since in addition the much larger mansfield dam was built by the lcra upstream of austin to form lake travis a flood-control reservoir 54 in the early 20th century the texas oil boom took hold creating tremendous economic opportunities in southeast texas and north texas the growth generated by this boom largely passed by austin at first with the city slipping from fourth largest to tenth largest in texas between 1880 and 1920 33 after a severe lull in economic growth from the great depression austin resumed its steady development following the mid-20th century austin became established as one of texas major metropolitan centers in 1970 the us census bureau reported austins population as 14.5% hispanic 11.9% black and 73.4% non-hispanic white 42 in the late 20th century austin emerged as an important high tech center for semiconductors and software the university of texas at austin emerged as a major university 55 the 1970s saw austins emergence in the national music scene with local artists such as willie nelson asleep at the wheel and stevie ray vaughan and iconic music venues such as the armadillo world headquarters over time the long-running television program austin city limits its namesake austin city limits festival and the south by southwest music festival solidified the citys place in the music industry 23 ## geography austin the southernmost state capital of the contiguous 48 states is located in central texas on the colorado river austin is 146 miles 230 km northwest of houston 56 182 miles 290 km south of dallas 57 and 74 miles 120 km northeast of san antonio 58 austin occupies a total area of 305.1 square miles 790.1 km 2 approximately 7.2 square miles 18.6 km 2 of this area is water 7 austin is situated at the foot of the balcones escarpment on the colorado river with three artificial lakes within the city limits lady bird lake formerly known as town lake lake austin both created by dams along the colorado river and lake walter e long that is partly used for cooling water for the decker power plant mansfield dam and the foot of lake travis are located within the citys limits 33 lady bird lake lake austin and lake travis are each on the colorado river 33 the elevation of austin varies from 425 feet 130 m to approximately 1000 feet 305 m above sea level 59 due to the fact it straddles the balcones fault much of the eastern part of the city is flat with heavy clay and loam soils whereas the western part and western suburbs consist of rolling hills on the edge of the texas hill country 60 because the hills to the west are primarily limestone rock with a thin covering of topsoil portions of the city are frequently subjected to flash floods from the runoff caused by thunderstorms 61 62 to help control this runoff and to generate hydroelectric power the lower colorado river authority operates a series of dams that form the texas highland lakes the lakes also provide venues for boating swimming and other forms of recreation within several parks on the lake shores 63 austin is located at the intersection of four major ecological regions and is consequently a temperate-to-hot green oasis with a highly variable climate having some characteristics of the desert the tropics and a wetter climate 64 65 the area is very diverse ecologically and biologically and is home to a variety of animals and plants 66 notably the area is home to many types of wildflowers that blossom throughout the year but especially in the spring this includes the popular bluebonnets some planted by lady bird johnson wife of former president lyndon b johnson 67 the soils of austin range from shallow gravelly clay loams over limestone in the western outskirts to deep fine sandy loams silty clay loams silty clays or clays in the citys eastern part some of the clays have pronounced shrink-swell properties and are difficult to work under most moisture conditions many of austins soils especially the clay-rich types are slightly to moderately alkaline and have free calcium carbonate 68 ## cityscape austins skyline historically was modest dominated by the texas state capitol and the university of texas main building however since the 2000s many new high-rise towers have been constructed 69 austin is currently undergoing a skyscraper boom which includes recent construction on new office hotel and residential buildings downtowns buildings are somewhat spread out partly due to a set of zoning restrictions that preserve the view of the texas state capitol from various locations around austin known as the capitol view corridors 70 at night parts of austin are lit by artificial moonlight from moonlight towers built to illuminate the central part of the city 71 the 165-foot 50 m moonlight towers were built in the late 19th century and are now recognized as historic landmarks only 15 of the 31 original innovative towers remain standing in austin but none remain in any of the other cities where they were installed the towers are featured in the 1993 film dazed and confused in december 2023 amid rising home prices the austin city council loosened the citys zoning rules to permit by-right development of triplexes on each lot and loosened restrictions on tiny homes 72 the central business district of austin is home to the tallest condo towers in the state with the independent 58 stories and 690 ft 210 m tall and the austonian topping out at 56 floors and 685 ft 209 m tall the independent became the tallest all-residential building in the us west of chicago when topped out in 2018 in 2005 then-mayor will wynn set out a goal of having 25000 people living downtown by 2015 73 although downtowns growth did not meet this goal downtowns residential population did surge from an estimated 5000 in 2005 to 12000 in 2015 74 the skyline has drastically changed in recent years and the residential real estate market has remained relatively strong as of december 2016 update there were 31 high rise projects either under construction approved or planned to be completed in austins downtown core between 2017 and 2020 sixteen of those were set to rise above 400 ft 120 m tall including four above 600 and eight above 500 an additional 15 towers were slated to stand between 300 and 399 tall ## climate austin climate chart explanation j f m a m j j a s o n d 2.2 61 41 2 65 45 2.8 72 51 2.1 80 59 4.4 86 67 4.3 92 72 1.9 95 74 2.4 97 75 3 91 70 3.9

american southwest and the lush green more humid regions of the american southeast its climate topography and vegetation share characteristics of both officially austin has a humid subtropical climate cfa under the köppen climate classification cfhl under the trewartha climate classification this climate is typified by long very hot summers short mild winters and warm to hot spring and fall seasons in-between austin averages 34.32 inches 872 mm of annual rainfall distributed mostly evenly throughout the year though spring and fall are the wettest seasons sunshine is common during all seasons with 2650 hours or 60.3% of the possible total of bright sunshine per year 75 summers in austin are very hot with average july and august highs frequently reaching the high-90s 34–36 °c or above highs reach 90 °f 32 °c on 123 days per year of which 29 days reach 100 °f 38 °c all years in the 1991-2020 period recorded at least 1 day of the latter 76 the average daytime high is 70 °f 21 °c or warmer

temperature was 112 °f 44 °c occurring on september 5 2000 and august 28 2011 77 78 an uncommon characteristic of austins climate is its highly variable humidity which fluctuates frequently depending on the shifting patterns of air flow and wind direction it is common for a lengthy series of warm dry low-humidity days to be occasionally interrupted by very warm and humid days and vice versa humidity rises with winds from the east or southeast when the air drifts inland from the gulf of mexico but decreases significantly with winds from the west or southwest bringing air flowing from chihuahuan desert areas of west texas or northern mexico 76 winters in austin are mild although occasional short-lived bursts of cold weather known as blue northers can occur january is the coolest month with an average daytime high of 62.5 °f 17 °c the overnight low drops to or below freezing 12 times per year 76 and sinks below 45 °f 7 °c during 76 evenings per year mostly between mid-december and mid-february the average first and last dates for a freeze are december 1 and february 15 giving austin an average growing season of 288 days and the coldest temperature of the year is normally about 24.2 °f −4 °c under the 1991-2020 climate normals putting austin in usda zone 9a 76 conversely winter months also produce warm days on a regular basis on average 10 days in january reach or exceed 70 °f 21 °c and 1 day reaches 80 °f 27 °c during the 1991-2020 period all januarys had at least 1 day with a high of 70 °f 21 °c or more and most 60% had at least 1 day with a high of 80 °f 27 °c or more 76 the lowest ever recorded temperature in the city was −2 °f −19 °c on january 31 1949 roughly every two years austin experiences an ice storm that freezes roads over and cripples travel in the city for 24 to 48 hours 79 when austin received 0.04 inches 1 mm of ice on january 24 2014 there were 278 vehicular collisions 80 similarly snowfall is rare in austin 81 a snow event of 0.9 inches 2 cm on february 4 2011 caused more than 300 car crashes 82 the most recent major snow event occurred february 14–15 2021 when 6.4 inches 16 cm of snow fell at austins camp mabry the largest two-day snowfall since records began being kept in 1948 83 84 typical of central texas severe weather in austin is a threat that can strike during any season however it is most common during the spring according to most classifications austin lies within the extreme southern periphery of tornado alley although many sources place austin outside of tornado alley altogether 85 consequently tornadoes strike austin less frequently than areas farther to the north 85 however severe weather and or supercell thunderstorms can occur multiple times per year bringing damaging winds lightning heavy rain and occasional flash flooding to the city 86 the deadliest storm to ever strike city limits was the twin tornadoes storm of may 4 1922 while the deadliest tornado outbreak to ever strike

redistricting before then austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district–what was then the 10th district–for over a century opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan gerrymandering and the plan was challenged in court by democratic and minority activists the supreme court of the united states has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan the plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003 and on june 28 2006 the matter was largely settled when the supreme court in a 7–2 decision upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a hispanic-majority district in southwest texas this affected austins districting as us rep lloyd doggett s district us congressional district 25 was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced minority influence in the southwest district it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern travis county and several counties to its south and east 342 the distinguishing political movement of austin politics has been that of the environmental movement which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement then the more recent conservationist movement as typified by the hill country conservancy 343 and eventually the current ongoing debate about sense of place and preserving the austin quality of life much of the environmental movement has matured into a debate on issues related to saving and creating an austin sense of place 193 in 2012 austin became just one of a few cities in texas to ban the sale and use of plastic bags however the ban ended in 2018 due to a court ruling that regarded all bag bans in the state to contravene the texas solid waste disposal act 344 in 2016 austin became the first gold designee of the solsmart program 345 a national program from the us department of energy that recognizes local governments for enacting
