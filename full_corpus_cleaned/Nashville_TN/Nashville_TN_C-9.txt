center of plantations cultivating tobacco and hemp as commodity crops in addition to the breeding and training of thoroughbred horses and other livestock for years nashville was considered one of the wealthiest southern capitals and a large portion of its prominence was from the iron business nashville led the south for iron production 33 the cholera epidemic that struck nashville in 1849–1850

beacon of hope and cultural pride by 1871 this ensemble began touring the us and europe earning international acclaim for their performances ofnegro spirituals 42 their success not only provided vital funding for their university 43 but also marked nashville as a significant center for african american music and culture laying the groundwork for the citys enduring musical legacy in 1873 nashville suffered another cholera epidemic along with towns throughout sumner county along railroad routes and the cumberland river this was part of a larger epidemic that struck the mississippi valley system and other areas of the united states such as new york and towns along its major lakes and rivers the epidemic is estimated to have killed around 1000 people in nashville 44 and 50000 total meanwhile the city had reclaimed its important shipping and trading position and developed a solid manufacturing base the post–civil war years of the late 19th century brought new prosperity to nashville and davidson county wealthy planters and businessmen built grand classical-style buildings a replica of theparthenonwas constructed incentennial park near downtown 45 on april 30 1892ephraim grizzard an african-american man waslynchedin a spectacle murder in front of a white mob of 10000 in nashville he was a suspect in the assault of two white sisters 46 his lynching was described by journalistida b

nearby goodlettsville as a suspect in the same assault incident from 1877 to 1950 a total of six lynchings of blacks were conducted in davidson county four before the turn of the century 48 ### earlier 20th century by the turn of the century nashville was home to numerous organizations and individuals associated with revisionistlost cause of the confederacypseudohistory and it has been referred to as the cradle of the lost cause 49 in 1893 the magazineconfederate veteranbegan publication in the city 50 in 1894 the first chapter ofunited daughters of the confederacywas founded in the city and it hosted the first two conventions of the organization 51 prominent proponents of the mythology the so-called guardians of the lost cause were concentrated downtown and in the west end nearcentennial park 49 at the same timejefferson streetbecame the historic center of the african american community with similar districts developing in the black neighborhoods in east and north nashville in 1912 thetennessee agricultural and industrial and normal schoolwas moved to jefferson street 37 the firstprinces hot chicken shackoriginated at the corner of jefferson street and 28th avenue in 1945 37 jefferson street became a destination for jazz and blues musicians 37 and remained so until the federal government split the area by construction ofinterstate 40in the late 1960s 52 in 1925 the establishment of thegrand ole oprymarked the beginning of nashvilles journey as the country music capital of the world 53 drawing musicians and fans alike to the city and setting the stage for its future as a country music powerhouse 54 ### mid-20th century in 1950 the state legislature approved a new city charter that provided for the election of city council members fromsingle-member districts rather thanat-largevoting this change was supported because at-large voting required candidates to gain a majority of votes from across the city the previous system prevented the minority population which then tended to support republican candidates from being represented by candidates of their choice apportionment under single-member districts meant that some districts in nashville had black majorities in 1951 after passage of the new charter african american attorneysz alexander loobyand robert e lillard were elected to the city council 55 in the late-1940s recording studios began to set up shop in nashville to record artists who performed at the grand ole opry 56 then in 1950 the radio announcer david cobb ad libbed on air “the sounds listeners were hearing on wsm radio were coming from ‘music city usa’ ” coining the moniker music city 57 58 during the mid-1950s nashville underwent a musical transformation with the emergence of the nashville sound which was characterized by smooth strings and choruses sophisticated background vocals and smooth tempos associated withtraditional pop 59 60 the new sound broadened country musics appeal and solidified nashvilles status as a music recording and production center with the united states supreme court ruling in 1954 that public schools had to desegregate with all deliberate speed the family of student robert kelley filed a lawsuit in 1956 arguing that nashville administrators should open all-white east high school to him a similar case was filed byreverendhenry maxwell due to his children having to take a 45-minute bus ride from south nashville to the north end of the city these suits caused the courts to announce what became known as the nashville plan where the citys public schools would desegregate one grade per year beginning in the fall of 1957 37 urban redevelopment accelerated over the next several decades and the city grew increasingly segregated an interstate was placed on the edge of east nashville while another highway was built through edgehill a lower-income predominantly minority community 37 ### postwar development to end of 20th century rapid suburbanization occurred during the years immediately afterworld war ii as new housing was being built outside city limits this resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities which the county found difficult to provide at the same time suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services that were supported financially only by city taxpayers after years of discussion a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government it failed to gain approval although it was supported by the then-elected leaders of both jurisdictions county judgebeverly brileyand mayorben west 61 following the referendums failure nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base this increased uncertainty among residents and created resentment among many suburban communities under the second charter for metropolitan government which was approved in 1962 two levels of service provision were proposed the general services district and the urban services district to provide for a differential in tax levels residents of the urban services district had a full range of city services the areas that made up the general services district however had a lower tax rate until full services were provided 61 this helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region in the early 1960s tennessee still had racial segregation of public facilities including lunch counters and department store fitting rooms hotels and restaurants were also segregated between february 13 and may 10 1960a series of sit-inswere organized at lunch counters in downtown nashville by thenashville student movementand nashville christian leadership council and were part of a broadersit-in movementin the southeastern united states as part of an effort to end racial segregation of public facilities 62 on february 13 1960 thenashville sit-insbegan although the nashville students trained by activists and nonviolent teachersjames lawsonandmyles horton had been doing preliminary groundwork towards the action for two months 63 64 on april 19 1960 the house ofz alexander looby an african american attorney and council member was bombed by segregationists 63 64 65 protesters marched to the city hall the next day when mayorben westsaid he supported the desegregation of lunch counters which civil rights activists had called for 66 64 67 the sit-in ended successfully in may under mayor west 63 64 in 1963 nashville consolidated its government with davidson county forming ametropolitan government the membership on the metro council the legislative body was increased from 21 to 40 seats of these five members are electedat-largeand 35 are elected fromsingle-member districts each to serve a term of four years 61 as nashville evolved in the 1960s its music scene diversified welcomingrockpop and other genres and the nashville sound transformed into countrypolitan artists likebob dylanandjohnny cashcame to nashville to record reflecting the citys expanding influence in the music industry 68 69 in

democrats have carried nashville at the presidential level with relatively little difficulty even in years when they lose tennessee as a whole this has been especially true in recent elections as the

7th districts in a partisangerrymanderan additional republican to tennessees congressional delegation as part of the2022 redistricting cycle 268 this republican gerrymander cracked the democratic stronghold of nashville across three otherwise republican districts ensuring three republican representatives this gerrymander diminished the influence of black voters and other voters of color

in the state 269 prior to this gerrymander republicans made a few spirited challenges to the 5th district in the mid-1960s and early 1970s almost winning the district in 1968 the last serious bid for the district while still a democratic stronghold was in 1972 when the republican candidate gained 38% of the vote even as nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin the districts best-known congressman was probablyjo byrns who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and wasspeaker of the housefor much offranklin roosevelts first term as president another
