incident from 1877 to 1950 a total of six lynchings of blacks were conducted in davidson county four before the turn of the century 48 ### earlier 20th century by the turn of the century nashville was home to numerous organizations and individuals associated with revisionistlost cause of the confederacypseudohistory and it has been referred to as the cradle of the lost cause 49 in 1893 the magazineconfederate veteranbegan publication in the city 50 in 1894 the first chapter ofunited daughters of the confederacywas founded in the city and it hosted the first two conventions of the organization 51 prominent proponents of the mythology the so-called guardians of the lost cause were concentrated downtown and in the west end nearcentennial park 49 at the same timejefferson streetbecame the historic center of the african american community with similar districts developing in the black neighborhoods in east and north nashville in 1912 thetennessee agricultural and industrial and normal schoolwas moved to jefferson street 37 the firstprinces hot chicken shackoriginated at the corner of jefferson street and 28th avenue in 1945 37 jefferson street became a destination for jazz and blues musicians 37 and remained so until the federal government split the area by construction ofinterstate 40in the late 1960s 52 in 1925 the establishment of thegrand ole oprymarked the beginning of nashvilles journey as the country music capital of the world 53 drawing musicians and fans alike to the city and setting the stage for its future as a country music powerhouse 54 in 1950 the state legislature approved a new city charter that provided for the election of city council members fromsingle-member districts rather thanat-largevoting this change was supported because at-large voting required candidates to gain a majority of votes from across the city the previous system prevented the minority population which then tended to support republican candidates from being represented by candidates of their choice apportionment under single-member districts meant that some districts in nashville had black majorities in 1951 after passage of the new charter african american attorneysz alexander loobyand robert e lillard were elected to the city council 55 during the mid-1950s nashville underwent a musical transformation with the emergence of the nashville sound which was characterized by smooth strings and choruses sophisticated background vocals and smooth tempos associated withtraditional pop 56 57 the new sound broadened country musics appeal and solidified nashvilles status as a music recording and production center with the united states supreme court ruling in 1954 that public schools had to desegregate with all deliberate speed the family of student robert kelley filed a lawsuit in 1956 arguing that nashville administrators should open all-white east high school to him a similar case was filed byreverendhenry maxwell due to his children having to take a 45-minute bus ride from south nashville to the north end of the city these suits caused the courts to announce what became known as the nashville plan where the citys public schools would desegregate one grade per year beginning in the fall of 1957 37 urban redevelopment accelerated over the next several decades and the city grew increasingly segregated an interstate was placed on the edge of east nashville while another highway was built through edgehill a lower-income predominantly minority community 37 ### postwar development to present rapid suburbanization occurred during the years immediately afterworld war ii as new housing was being built outside city limits this resulted in a demand for many new schools and other support facilities which the county found difficult to provide at the same time suburbanization led to a declining tax base in the city although many suburban residents used unique city amenities and services that were supported financially only by city taxpayers after years of discussion a referendum was held in 1958 on the issue of consolidating city and county government it failed to gain approval although it was supported by the then-elected leaders of both jurisdictions county judgebeverly brileyand mayorben west 58 following the referendums failure nashville annexed some 42 square miles of suburban jurisdictions to expand its tax base this increased uncertainty among residents and created resentment among many suburban communities under the second charter for metropolitan government which was approved in 1962 two levels of service provision were proposed the general services district and the urban services district to provide for a differential in tax levels residents of the urban services district had a full range of city services the areas that made up the general services district however had a lower tax rate until full services were provided 58 this helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region in the early 1960s tennessee still had racial segregation of public facilities including lunch counters and department store fitting rooms hotels and restaurants were also segregated between february 13 and may 10 1960a series of sit-inswere organized at lunch counters in downtown nashville by thenashville student movementand nashville christian leadership council and were part of a broadersit-in movementin the southeastern united states as part of an effort to end racial segregation of public facilities 59 on april 19 1960 the house ofz alexander looby an african american attorney and council member was bombed by segregationists 60 protesters marched to the city hall the next day mayor ben west said he supported the desegregation of lunch counters which civil rights activists had called for 61 in 1963 nashville consolidated its government with davidson county forming ametropolitan government the membership on the metro council the legislative body was increased from 21 to 40 seats of these five members are electedat-largeand 35 are elected fromsingle-member districts each to serve a term of four years 58 as nashville evolved in the 1960s its music scene diversified welcomingrockpop and other genres and the nashville sound transformed into countrypolitan artists likebob

nashville by 1966 the metro council abandoned the grade a year plan and completely desegregated the entire school system at one time 65 congress passed civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965 but

nashville has been ademocraticstronghold since at least the end ofreconstruction and has remained staunchly democratic even as the state as a whole has trended stronglyrepublican pockets of republican influence exist in the wealthier portions of the city but they are usually no match for the overwhelming democratic trend in the rest of the city the issue of school busing roiled politics for years

and 1988 252 in most years democrats have carried nashville at the presidential level with relatively little difficulty even in years when they lose tennessee as a whole this has been especially true

district the5th for most of its history a republican had not represented a significant portion of nashville since 1874 until 2023 when the gop-controlled state legislature controversially split nashville into parts of the 5th6th and 7th districts in a partisangerrymanderan additional republican to tennessees congressional delegation as part of the2022 redistricting cycle 253 this republican gerrymander ‘cracked’ the democratic stronghold of nashville across three otherwise republican districts ensuring three republican representatives this gerrymander ‘diminished the influence of black voters and other voters of color concentrated in nashville’ by splitting them up and adding portions of the nashville community into districts that are overwhelmingly white and republican thus diluting the voting power of black voters in the state 254 prior to this gerrymander republicans made a few spirited challenges to the 5th district in the mid-1960s and early 1970s almost winning the district in 1968 the last serious bid for the district while still a democratic stronghold was in 1972 when the republican candidate gained 38% of the vote even as nixon carried the district in the presidential election by a large margin the districts best-known congressman was probablyjo byrns who represented the district from 1909 to 1936 and wasspeaker of the housefor much offranklin
