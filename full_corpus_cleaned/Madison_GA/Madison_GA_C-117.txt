one of the states historic heartland cities history early 19th century madison was described in an early 19th-century issue of whites statistics of georgia as the most cultured and aristocratic town on the stagecoach route from charleston to new orleans in an 1849 edition of whites statistics of georgia the following was written about madison in point of intelligence refinement and hospitality this town acknowledges no superior on december 12 1809 the town named for 4th united states president james madison was incorporated while many believe that sherman spared the town because it was too beautiful to burn during his march to the sea the truth is that madison was home to pro-union congressman later senator joshua hill hill had ties with general william tecumseh shermans brother in the house of representatives so his sparing the town was more political than appreciation of its beauty jim crow era in 1895 madison was reported to have an oil mill with a capital of $35000 a soap factory a fertilizer factory four steam ginneries a mammoth compress two carriage factories a furniture factory a grist and flouringmill a bottling works a distillery with a capacity of 120 gallons a day an ice factory with a capital of $10500 a canning factory with a capital of $10000 a bank with a capital of $75000 surplus $12000 and a number of small industries operated by individual enterprise against the backdrop of this jim crow-era prosperity white madisonians participated in at least three documented lynchings of african americans in february of 1890 after a rushed trial involving knife-wielding jurors brown washington a 15-year-old was found guilty of the murder of a 9-year-old local white girl after the verdict though the sheriff with the governor’s approval called up the madison home guard to protect washington “only three militiamen and none of the officers” responded to the order washington was thus easily taken from jail by a posse of ten men organized by a “leading local businessman” described as “among the best citizens” they promptly handed him over to a mob of 300+ waiting outside the courthouse from there he was taken to a telegraph pole behind a mr poullains residence allowed a prayer then strung up and shot his body mutilated by more than a hundred bullets afterwards in the patriarchal exhibition-style common of southern lynchings a sign was posted on the telegraph pole “our women and children will be protected” his body was not taken down until noon the next day according to brundages account of the lynching of brown washington in lynching in the new south georgia and virginia 1880-1930 the open participation of men of all ages and standing in life the carefully organized public meeting that planned the mob’s course of action the obvious complicity of the militia and the ritualized execution of washington all highlight the degree to which the lynching was sanctioned by the community at large shared attitudes toward women sexuality and black criminality combined with local bonds of community and family focused the fears and rage of whites on washington and guaranteed mass involvement in his execution in the aftermath though local and state authorities vowed to thoroughly investigate the lynching as well as the madison home guard’s dereliction of duty just a week later a grand jury was advised by a judge of the superior court of madison that any investigation would be a waste of time in addition the state body charged with investigating the home guard’s non-response reported that their absence had been satisfactorily explained and no tribunal would be convened to investigate the matter” although the local madisonian newspaper failed to report on the 1890 extra-judicial murder of mr washington an even earlier first lynching by madisonians of a man they similarly pulled out of the old stone county jail appears in the contemporary accounts from the atlanta constitution in 1919 ten years after the erection of a lost cause memorial in front of the newly-built morgan county courthouse a third lynching occurred in the dark of night a few days before thanksgiving this time citizens skipped the show-trials altogether opting to travel to the home of mr wallace baynes in what one paper of the day called an arresting party though no charges against mr baynes were stipulated in the news account baynes shot at the party striking mr frank f ozburn of madison in the head killing him instantly in response the mob outside his home grew to 40-50 men despite the arrival of madison sheriff cs baldwin mr baynes was pulled from his home by a rope and shot him near the little river afterwards the sheriff present at the lynching said he could not identify any of the men who came for mr baynes despite the fact that they arrived in cars and lit up mr baynes home with the headlights of their vehicles in an editorial that argued that mobs in the south were no worse than mobs in the north yet condemned future lynchings the local madisonian claimed “there is not now and perhaps will never be any friction between the races here” the lost cause monument erected in 1909 by the morgan county daughters of the confederacy in front of the courthouse where mr baynes was not afforded a trial was inscribed in part no nation rose so white and fair none fell so pure of crime in the 1950s the monument was moved to hill park a madison city property donated by the descendants of joshua hill the aforementioned pro-union senator who before the civil war resigned his position rather than
