named for united states navy commodore stephen decatur shallowford road which led to the shallow ford has been renamed clairmont avenue probably because it does not go to from or past any place called

atlanta confederate cavalry under major-general joseph wheeler attacked mcphersons supply wagons and the union troops left to defend the wagons a historical marker at the old courthouse marks the site of this skirmish we attacked decatur on the 22d and took the town driving out a brigade of infantry and a good deal of dismounted cavalry our brigade really took the town tho it was supported on both flanks by a brigade of cavalry dismounted the fight lasted about two hours and was very hot for a while the yankees had the hills and houses on us and fought very well for a time our dash was made to distract attention while hardee made the real attack on the enemys flank we captured over a hundred prisoners and killed and wounded about one hundred and fifty our loss about seventy killed and
