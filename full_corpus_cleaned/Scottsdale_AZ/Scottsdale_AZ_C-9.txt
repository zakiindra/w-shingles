in 1956 the town began a period of rapid population growth after its incorporation in 1951 growing from 2000 to 10000 residents during the 1950s this growth necessitated development into the floodplain known as the indian bend wash floodplains throughout history have been enticing locations for development due to their flatness ease of building and inexpensiveness this is even more tempting in a desert where flooding so rarely happens as scottsdale expanded the north-south indian bend wash virtually bisected the city in the late 1950s the problem became more and more pronounced until in 1959 the arizona state legislature formed the maricopa county flood control district mcfcd the mcfcd became the lead player in developing a comprehensive flood plan for the entire county at the same time the united states army corps of engineers began to look into flooding in maricopa county over the next several years it presented several plans which all revolved around constructing concrete canals and levees to channel and divert the floodwaters as well as building bridges over the canal similar to the storm drains of los angeles but during mcfcd meetings between 1961 and 1963 a different course of action was developed this plan became known as the multi-use or greenbelt concept the two concepts were at odds with one another until the canal plan was defeated in a bond referendum in 1965 in 1966 a study was commissioned that validated the greenbelt concept as a way to prevent flood damage after a major flood in 1972 work on the greenbelt project began in earnest it was completed in 1984 although minor projects continue today the scottsdale greenbelt connects four city parks—vista del camino park eldorado park indian school park and chaparral park—through a bike
