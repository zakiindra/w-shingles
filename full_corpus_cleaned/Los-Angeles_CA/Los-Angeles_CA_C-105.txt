english pronunciation of the name of the city has varied over time a 1953 article in the journal of the american name society asserts that the pronunciation l ɔː s ˈ æ n dʒ əl ə s lawss an -jəl-əs was established following the 1850 incorporation of the city and that since the 1880s the pronunciation l oʊ s ˈ æ ŋ ɡ əl ə s lohss ang -gəl-əs emerged from a trend in california to give places spanish or spanish-sounding names and pronunciations in 1908 librarian charles fletcher lummis who argued for the names pronunciation with a hard g ɡ reported that there were at least 12 pronunciation variants in the early 1900s the los angeles times advocated for pronouncing it loce ahng-hayl-ais l oʊ s ˈ ɑː ŋ h eɪ l eɪ s approximating spanish los ˈaŋxeles by printing the respelling under its masthead for several years this did not find favor since the 1930s l ɔː s ˈ æ n dʒ əl ə s has been most common in 1934 the united states board on geographic names decreed that this pronunciation be used by the federal government this was also endorsed in 1952 by a jury appointed by mayor fletcher bowron to devise an official pronunciation common pronunciations in the united kingdom include l ɒ s ˈ æ n dʒ ɪ

ending in -‍es reflecting a time when the classics were familiar if spanish was not history indigenous history the settlement of indigenous californians in the modern los angeles basin and the san fernando valley was dominated by the tongva now also known as the gabrieleño since the era of spanish colonization the historic center of tongva power in the region was the settlement of yaanga tongva iyáangẚ meaning place of the poison oak which would one day be the site where the spanish founded the pueblo de los ángeles iyáangẚ has also been translated as the valley of smoke spanish rule maritime explorer juan rodríguez cabrillo claimed the area of southern california for the spanish empire in 1542 while on an official military exploring expedition as he was moving northward along the pacific coast from earlier colonizing bases of new spain in central and south america gaspar de portolà and franciscan missionary juan crespí reached the present site of los angeles on august 2 1769 in 1771 franciscan friar junípero serra directed the building of the mission san gabriel arcángel the first mission in the area on september 4 1781 a group of 44 settlers known as los pobladores founded the pueblo town they called el pueblo de nuestra señora la reina de los ángeles the town of our lady the queen of the angels the present-day city has the largest roman catholic archdiocese in the united states two-thirds of the mexican or new spain settlers were mestizo or mulatto a mixture of african indigenous and european ancestry the settlement remained a small ranch town for decades

mexican rule new spain achieved its independence from the spanish empire in 1821 and the pueblo now existed within the new mexican republic during mexican rule governor pío pico made los angeles the regional capital of alta california by this time the new republic introduced more secularization acts within the los angeles region in 1846 during the wider mexican-american war marines from the united states occupied the pueblo this resulted in the siege of los angeles where 150 mexican militias fought the occupiers which eventually surrendered mexican rule ended during following the american conquest of california part of the larger mexican-american war americans took control from the californios after a series of battles culminating with the signing of the treaty of cahuenga on january 13 1847 the mexican cession was formalized in the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo in 1848 which ceded los angeles and the rest of alta california to the united states post-conquest era railroads arrived with the completion of the transcontinental southern pacific line from new orleans to los angeles in 1876 and the santa fe railroad in 1885 petroleum was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892 and by 1923 the discoveries had helped california become the countrys largest oil producer accounting for about one-quarter of the worlds petroleum output by 1900 the population had grown to more than 102000 putting pressure on the citys water supply the completion of the los angeles aqueduct in 1913 under the supervision of william mulholland ensured the continued growth of the city because of clauses in the citys charter that prevented the city of los angeles from selling or providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders many adjacent cities and communities felt compelled to join los angeles los angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the united states on september 14 1908 the los angeles city council promulgated residential and industrial land use zones the new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type where industrial uses were prohibited the proscriptions included barns lumber yards and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment these laws were enforced against industrial properties after the fact these prohibitions were in addition to existing activities that were already regulated as nuisances these included explosives warehousing gas works oil drilling slaughterhouses and tanneries los angeles city council also designated seven industrial zones within the city however between 1908 and 1915 the los angeles city council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to these three residential zones and as a consequence some industrial uses emerged within them there are two differences between the 1908 residence district ordinance and later zoning laws in the united states first the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the 1916 new york city zoning ordinance did second the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing they treated apartments hotels and detached-single-family housing equally in 1910 hollywood merged into los angeles with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time by 1921 more than 80 percent of the worlds film industry was concentrated in la the money generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the great depression by 1930 the population surpassed one million in 1932 the city hosted the summer olympics post-wwii during world war ii los angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing such as shipbuilding and aircraft calship built hundreds of liberty ships and victory ships on terminal island and the los angeles area was the headquarters of six of the countrys major aircraft manufacturers douglas aircraft company hughes aircraft lockheed north american aviation northrop corporation and vultee during the war more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the wright brothers flew the first airplane in 1903 combined manufacturing in los angeles skyrocketed and as william s knudsen of the national defense advisory commission put it we won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production the like of which he had never seen nor dreamed possible after the end of world war ii los angeles grew more rapidly than ever sprawling into the san fernando valley the expansion of the state owned interstate highway system during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the citys privately owned electrified rail system once the worlds largest as a consequence of world war ii suburban growth and population density many amusement parks were built and operated in this area an example is beverly park which was located at the corner of beverly boulevard and la cienega before being closed and substituted by the beverly center in the second half of the 20th century los angeles substantially reduced the amount of housing that could be built by drastically downzoning the city in 1960 the city had a total zoned capacity for approximately 10 million people by 1990 that capacity had fallen to 4.5 million as a result of policy decisions to ban housing through zoning racial tensions led to the watts riots in 1965 resulting in 34 deaths and over 1000 injuries in 1969 california became the birthplace of the internet as the first arpanet transmission was sent from the university of california los angeles ucla to the stanford research institute in menlo park in 1973 tom bradley was elected as the citys first african american mayor serving for five terms until retiring in 1993 other events

population thus becoming the second largest city in the united states in 1984 the city hosted the summer olympic games for the second time despite being boycotted by 14 communist countries the 1984 olympics became more financially successful than any previous and the second olympics to turn a profit the other according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports was the 1932 summer olympics also held in los angeles racial tensions erupted on april 29 1992 with the acquittal by a simi valley jury of four los angeles police department lapd officers captured on videotape beating rodney king culminating in large-scale riots in 1994 the magnitude 6.7 northridge earthquake shook the city causing $12.5 billion in damage and 72 deaths the century ended with the rampart scandal one of the most extensive documented cases of police misconduct in american history 21st century in 2002 mayor james hahn led the campaign against secession resulting in voters defeating efforts by the san fernando valley and hollywood to secede from the city in 2022 karen bass became the citys first female mayor making los angeles the largest us city to have ever had a woman as mayor in january 2025 a series of

ring of fire the geologic instability has produced numerous faults which cause approximately 10000 earthquakes annually in southern california though most of them are too small to be felt the strike-slip san andreas fault system which sits at the boundary between the pacific plate and the north american plate passes through the los angeles metropolitan area the segment of the fault passing

eventually merged with los angeles these neighborhoods were developed piecemeal and are well-defined enough that the city has signage which marks nearly all of them overview the citys street patterns

angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation including the clean air act when the act was passed california was unable to create a state implementation plan that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards largely because of the level of pollution in los angeles generated by older vehicles more recently the state of california has led the
