britain and ireland c 1779 the catawba indians were the first known historic tribe to settle mecklenburg county in the charlotte area and were first recorded around 1567 according to spanish records 18th century edit the area that is now charlotte was first settled by european colonists around 1755 when thomas spratt and his family settled near what is now the elizabeth neighborhood thomas polk great-uncle of president james k polk who later married thomas spratts daughter built his house by the intersection of two native american trading paths between the yadkin and catawba rivers 42 one path ran north–south and was part of the great wagon road the second path ran east–west along what is now trade street by 1759 half the catawba tribe had died from smallpox an endemic disease among european colonists which the catawba had no natural immunity against at the time of their largest population the catawba population was 10000 but by 1826 the catawba population dropped to 110 43 the city of charlotte was developed first by a wave of migration of scots-irish presbyterians or ulster-scot settlers from ulster who dominated the culture of the southern piedmont region and made up the principal founding population in the backcountry german immigrants also settled in the area before the american revolutionary war but in smaller numbers they still contributed greatly to the early foundations of the region mecklenburg county was initially part of bath county 1696 to 1729 of the new hanover precinct which became new hanover county in 1729 the western portion of new hanover split into bladen county in 1734 and its western portion split into anson county in 1750 mecklenburg county was formed from anson county in 1762 further apportionment was made in 1792 after the american revolutionary war with cabarrus county formed from mecklenburg 44 nicknamed the queen city 45 like its county a few years earlier charlotte was named in honor of charlotte of mecklenburg-strelitz who had become the queen consort of great britain and ireland in 1761 seven years before the towns incorporation 46 a second nickname derives from the american revolutionary war when british commander general charles cornwallis 1st marquess cornwallis occupied the city but was driven out by hostile residents he wrote that charlotte was a hornets nest of rebellion leading to the historical nickname the hornets nest 47 within decades of polks settling the area grew to become the town of charlotte incorporated in 1768 48 though chartered as charlotte the name appears as a form of charlottesburgh on many maps until around 1800 49 a form of charlottetown also appears on maps of british origin depicting general cornwallis route of invasion 50 the crossroads in piedmont became the heart of uptown charlotte in 1770 surveyors marked the streets in a grid pattern for future development the east–west trading path became trade street and the great wagon road became tryon street in honor of william tryon a royal governor of colonial north carolina 51 the intersection of trade and tryon is commonly known today as trade and tryon or simply the square 42 and formally as independence square 52 while surveying the boundary between the carolinas in 1772 william moultrie stopped in charlotte whose five or six houses were very ordinary built of logs 53 local leaders came together in 1775 and signed the mecklenburg resolves more popularly known as the mecklenburg declaration of independence while not a true declaration of independence from british rule it is among the first such declarations that eventually led to the american revolution may 20 the traditional date of the signing of the declaration is celebrated annually in charlotte as mecdec with musket and cannon fire by reenactors in independence square north carolinas state flag and state seal also bear the date in 1799 in nearby cabarrus county 12-year-old conrad reed found a 17- pound rock which his family used as a doorstop three years later a jeweler determined it was nearly solid gold paying the family a paltry $3.50 54 the first documented gold find in the united states of any consequence set off the nations first gold rush many veins of gold were found in the area throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries leading to the 1837 founding of the charlotte mint 55 north carolina was the chief producer of gold in the united states until the sierra nevada was found in 1848 56 although the volume mined in the charlotte area was dwarfed by subsequent rushes 19th century edit in 1842 union county formed from mecklenburgs southeastern portion and a western portion of anson county these areas were all part of one of the original six judicial military districts of north carolina known as the salisbury district 57 charlotte is traditionally considered the home of southern presbyterianism but in the 19th century numerous churches including presbyterian baptist methodist episcopal lutheran and roman catholic formed eventually giving charlotte the nickname the city of churches 58 some groups still pan for gold occasionally in local streams and creeks the reed gold mine operated until 1912 59 the charlotte mint was active until 1861 when confederate forces seized it at the outbreak of the civil war the mint was not reopened at the wars end but the building albeit in a different location now houses the mint museum of art the citys first boom came after the civil war as charlotte became a cotton processing center and railroad hub by the 1880s charlotte sat astride the southern railway mainline from atlanta to washington dc farmers from miles around would bring cotton to the railroad platform in uptown local promotors began building textile factories starting with the 1881 charlotte cotton mill that still stands at graham and 5th streets 60 charlottes city population at the 1890 census grew to 11557 61 20th century edit aerial view of charlotte in 1932 in 1910 charlotte surpassed wilmington to become north carolinas largest city with 34014 residents 62 the population grew again during world war i when the us government established camp greene north of present-day wilkinson boulevard the camp supported 40000 soldiers with many troops and suppliers staying after the war launching urbanization that eventually overtook older cities along the piedmont crescent in the 1920 census charlotte fell to being the states second largest city winston-salem with 48395 people had two thousand more people than charlotte charlotte would pass winston-salem in population by the 1930 census and has remained north carolinas largest city since 63 until 1958 the seaboard air line railroad operated a daily passenger train from its own station which had opened in 1896 to wilmington 64 65 the citys modern-day banking industry achieved prominence in the 1970s and 1980s largely under the leadership of financier hugh mccoll mccoll transformed north carolina national bank ncnb into a formidable national bank that through aggressive acquisitions eventually merged with bankamerica to become bank of america first union later wachovia in 2001 experienced similar growth before it was acquired by san francisco –based wells fargo in 2008 measured by control of assets charlotte became the second largest banking headquarters in the united states after new york city 66 on september 22 1989 the city was hit by hurricane hugo with sustained winds of 69 mph 111 km h and gusts of 87 mph 140 km h 67 hugo caused massive property damage destroyed 80000 trees and knocked out electrical power to most of the population residents were without power for weeks schools were closed for a week or more and the cleanup took months the city was caught unprepared charlotte is 200 miles 320 km inland and residents from coastal areas in both carolinas often wait out hurricanes in charlotte 68 21st century edit in december 2002 charlotte and much of central north carolina were hit by an ice storm that resulted in more than 1.3 million people losing power 69 during an abnormally cold december many were without power for weeks many of the citys bradford pear trees split apart under the weight of the ice in august 2015 and september 2016 the city experienced several days of protests related to the police shootings of jonathan ferrell and keith scott 70 71 geography edit according to the united states census bureau the city has a total area of 312.00 square miles 808.1 km 2 of which 310.02 square miles 802.9 km 2 is land and 1.98 square miles 5.1 km 2 0.63% is water 7 charlotte is the twenty-sixth-most expansive city in the united states and lies at an elevation of 751 feet 229 m charlotte constitutes most of mecklenburg county in the carolina piedmont 72 uptown charlotte sits atop a long rise between two creeks sugar creek and irwin creek and was built on the gunnies of the st catherines and rudisill gold mines 73 charlotte is 25 miles 40 km southwest of concord 74 26 miles 42 km northeast of rock hill south carolina 75 83 miles 134 km southwest of greensboro 76 135 miles 217 km west of fayetteville 77 and 165 miles 266 km southwest of raleigh the state capital 78 though the catawba river and its lakes lie several miles west there are no significant bodies of water or other geological features near the city center 79 consequently development has neither been constrained nor helped by waterways or ports that have contributed to many cities of similar size the lack of these obstructions has contributed to charlottes growth as a highway rail and air transportation hub 80 neighborhoods edit see also list of charlotte neighborhoods and list of tallest buildings in charlotte uptown charlotte the southpark neighborhood the noda neighborhood and arts

system it is a huge milestone according to gwen cook greenway planner for mecklenburg county park and recreation 125 however the little sugar creek greenway bears no relation to the san antonio river walk the city of charlotte and mecklenburg county began purchasing flood-prone homes in the 1990s voluntary buyouts of 700 households have created around 200 acres 81 ha s of open land that can flood safely thereby saving an estimated $28 million in flood damage and emergency rescues 126 mcalpine creek park and integrated mcalpine creek greenway constructed in 1978 was the first greenway built in the western piedmont of north carolina 127 128 climate edit like much of the piedmont region of the southeastern united states charlotte has a humid subtropical climate köppen cfa with four distinct seasons charlotte is part of usda hardiness zone 8a transitioning to 7b in the suburbs in all directions except the south 129 the following narrative reflects 1991–2020 climate data winters are short and fairly mild with a normal january daily mean temperature of 42.1 °f 5.6 °c on occasion the temperature can fall below 20 °f −6.7 °c but charlotte also enjoys multiple warm winter days in excess of 65 °f 18.3 °c 130 on average there are 59 nights per year that drop to or below freezing and only 1.5 days that fail to rise above freezing 130 precipitation is evenly distributed through the year only august stands out as a slightly wetter month averaging 4.35 inches of rainfall summers are hot and humid with a normal july daily mean temperature of 80.1 °f 26.7 °c 131 hot and humid days can arrive as early as may and last to the end of september there is an average of 44 days per year with highs at or above 90 °f 32 °c 130 official record temperatures range from 104 °f 40 °c recorded six times on 6 september 1954 9–10 august 2007 and june 29 to july 1 2012 down to −5 °f −21 °c recorded on december 30 1880 february 14 1899 and january 21 1985 132 the record cold daily maximum is 14 °f −10 °c on february 12 and 13 1899 130 the record warm daily minimum is 82 °f 28 °c on august 13 1881 a the average window for freezing temperatures is november 5 to march 30 allowing a growing season of 220 days 130 charlotte is directly in the path of subtropical moisture from the gulf of mexico as it heads up the eastern seaboard thus the city receives ample precipitation throughout the year but also many clear sunny days precipitation is generally less frequent in autumn than in spring 130 on average charlotte receives 43.60 inches 1110 mm of precipitation annually evenly distributed throughout the year annual precipitation has historically ranged from 26.23 in 666 mm in 2001 to 68.44 in 1738 mm in 1884 130 there is an average of 3.5 inches 8.9 cm of snow mainly in january and february and rarely december or march with more frequent ice storms and sleet mixed in with rain seasonal snowfall has historically ranged from trace amounts in 2011–12 to 22.6 in 57 cm in 1959–60 130 snow and ice storms can have a major impact on the area as they often pull tree limbs down onto power lines and make driving hazardous snow has been recorded a small number of times in april most recently on april 2 2019 133 134 as of 2020 update the charlotte metropolitan area as a whole is noted for having one of the worst weather radar gaps among any major us east coast city with little to no coverage in a roughly quadrilateral area spanning concord salisbury and much of statesville 135 as the nearest nws -owned nexrad is located in greer south carolina more than 80 mi 130 km to the west-southwest of charlotte this deficit is particularly problematic during severe thunderstorm or tornado episodes 135 the current lowest angle of the radar based in greer is quite far above the surface over charlotte so the velocities measurement for detecting rotations cannot be below mid-level in potential tornado-forming storms and thus cannot indicate whether said rotation extends closer to the ground below 5000 ft 1500 m 135 climate data for charlotte north carolina charlotte douglas intl 1991–2020 normals b extremes 1878–present c month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov
