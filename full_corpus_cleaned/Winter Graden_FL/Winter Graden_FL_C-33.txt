winter garden is a city in western orange county florida united states located west of downtown orlando it is part of the orlando metropolitan area the population was 46964 as of the 2020 census ### history the pre-european history of the modern winter garden area is ambiguous due to a lack of evidence historians hesitate to conclude if the natives that once occupied the area were of the timucua jororo or mayaca tribes regardless of their tribal identity these natives were either wiped out or subsumed into larger cultures by the end of the eighteenth century following the eradication of the original floridian cultures natives from farther north migrated into florida these natives had various cultures that over time coalesced into the seminole tribe by the early 19th century some seminole lived on the south shore of lake apopka the settlement possibly produced the significant seminole leader wild cat in 1835 the second seminole war began threatening the seminole presence on january 23 1837 a small battle was fought near the village thomas s jesup at that time in command of all american forces in florida sent a detachment to lake apopka to seek a seminole chief known as osuchee or copper during the attack the army successfully killed osuchee and three other seminoles while taking 17 prisoners the second and third seminole wars both pushed the seminole tribe south likely eliminating their presence in the boundaries of modern winter garden the first american settlers came to what is now winter garden in the 1850s the roper reams dunaway speer and starke families were among the first to settle the area as with most american pioneers they engaged in agriculture as a primary economic activity these farms mainly grew sugar cane and vegetables and early on a small number utilized slave labor during the civil war steamboat traffic stopped along the st johns river forcing winter garden families to subsist off their own crops the arrival of the orange belt railroad and the growing production of citrus turpentine and lumber drove the towns growth over the remaining decades of the 19th century and into the 20th stores and businesses cropped up along plant street originating downtown winter garden a settler from mississippi named a b newton greatly contributed to the towns growth he opened one of the first stores served as the first postmaster founded the first newspaper and functioned as the first mayor these endeavors earned him the title the godfather of winter garden between the 1920s and 1960s the fishing prospects of lake apopka drew many fishermen to winter garden the still-operating edgewater hotel in downtown winter garden opened to service fishermen during the fishing boom however by the end of the 1960s heavy pollution of lake apopka resulted in the collapse of the industry citrus agriculture saw rapid growth in the state of florida in the last few decades of the 19th century including in winter garden as with the rest of the state the great freeze of 1894–1895 severely damaged the citrus industry in winter garden many settlers left town following this disaster leaving a smaller population to recover the areas farms despite this setback the industry recovered and saw many decades of growth through the middle stretch of the 20th century citrus defined winter gardens economy and culture in the 1980s back-to-back freezes greatly reduced the profitability of citrus farming in the county citrus production in winter garden and orange county never recovered since then the center of citrus production in florida has shifted south from orange county the increasing development of the orlando–kissimmee–sanford metropolitan area made it more profitable to sell grove lands to developers rather than attempt to restart them today little citrus activity occurs in the city limits of winter garden yet the town is proud of its citrus history oranges and grapefruits continue to be symbols of the town since 2000 winter garden has seen incredible growth despite the decline of citrus and the economic stagnation in the 1980s and 1990s developers entrepreneurs and city government made efforts to rejuvenate the downtown district attracting locals and tourists with a mix of small town atmosphere and trendy businesses this population and development growth endured through the great recession and continues today ###
