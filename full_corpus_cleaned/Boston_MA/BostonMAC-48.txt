where he his wife namesake of thearbella andjohn cotton grandfather ofcotton mather emigratedtonew england the name of the english town derives from its patron saintst botolph inwhose churchcotton

settlement on the peninsula was known as shawmut bywilliam blaxtonand tremontaine 30 by the puritan settlers he invited 31 32 33 34 35 ### history ### indigenous era prior toeuropean colonization the region surrounding present-day boston was inhabited by themassachusettpeople who established small seasonal communities in present-day boston 36 37 in 1630 settlers led byjohn winthroparrived and foundshawmut peninsulanearly empty of native people most had died of european diseases borne by earlier settlers and traders 38 39 archaeological excavations have unearthed one of the oldestfishweirsin new england located onboylston street which native people constructed as early as 7000 years before european arrival in thewestern hemisphere 37 36 40 ### european settlement the first european to live in what would become boston was auniversity of cambridge-educatedanglicancleric namedwilliam blaxton he was most directly responsible for the foundation of boston bypuritancolonists in 1630 after blaxton invited one of their leadersisaac johnson to crossback bayfrom the failing colony ofcharlestownand share the peninsula with him in september 1630 puritans made the crossing to present-day boston 41 42 43 puritan influence on boston began even before the settlement was founded with the 1629cambridge agreement which was created themassachusetts bay colonyand signed by the colonys first governorjohn winthrop puritan ethics and their focus on education also influenced the citys early history in 1635 americas first public schoolboston latin school was founded in boston 18 44 boston was the largest town in thethirteen coloniesuntilphiladelphiaoutgrew it in the mid-18th century 45 bostonsoceanfront locationmade it a livelyport and the town engaged inshippingand fishing during the colonial era boston was a primary stop on thecaribbeantrade routeand imported large amounts of molasses which led to the creation ofboston baked beans 46 bostons economy stagnated in the decades prior to the american revolution by the mid-18th century new york city and philadelphia both surpassed boston in wealth during this period boston encountered financial difficulties even as other new england cities were growing rapidly 47 48 ### revolution and the siege of boston the weather continuing boisterous the next day and night giving the enemy time to improve their works to bring up their cannon and to put themselves in such a state of defence that i could promise myself little success in attacking them under all the disadvantages i had to encounter boston played a central role in theamerican revolution many crucial events of the american revolution and subsequentamerican revolutionary waroccurred in or near boston where the citys revolutionary spirit 50 againstbritainscolonialgovernance was demonstrable and ultimately inspiring to the rest of thethirteen colonies 47 when thebritish parliamentpassed thestamp actin 1765 the homes ofandrew oliver the official tasked with enforcing the act andthomas hutchinson then lieutenant governor ofmassachusetts bay colony were raved by boston mobs 47 51 the british responded by sending two regiments to boston in 1768 in an attempt to quell the revolt but the increased british military presence in boston only ended up further inflaming the boston colonists in 1770 during theboston massacrebritish troopsfired into a boston mob that was protesting their presence the massacre forced the british to withdraw their troops and helped fuel revolutionary sentiment in the colonies 48 in may 1773 parliament passed thetea act which many colonists saw as a british attempt to compel them to accept taxes established by thetownshend acts this led to theboston tea party a defining event of the american revolution in which angered bostonians threw an entire shipment of tea sent from theeast india companyintoboston harbor escalating the american revolution the british monarchy responded furiously implementing theintolerable actsand demanding compensation for the tea destroyed during the boston tea party 47 this response in turn angered the colonists further leading to thebattles of lexington and concordon april 19 1775 the first battles of theamerican revolutionary war which were fought around boston in massachusetts bay colony 47 52 during thesiege of bostonfrom april 19 1775 to march 17 1776 new england-basedpatriotmilitia impeded movement by thebritish armysir william howe then commander-in-chief of british forces in north america led the british army in the siege on june 17 the british captured charlestown in present-day boston during thebattle of bunker hillduring which the british army outnumbered patriot militia but the british sustained irreplaceable casualties turning the battle of bunker hill into apyrrhic victoryfor the british the battle of bunker hill also demonstrated the skill and training of the patriot militia whose stubborn defense made it difficult for the british to capture charlestown without suffering even further casualties 53 54 on june 14 1775 in an effort to unify the revolutionary war effort thesecond continental congress convening in the colonial-era capital ofphiladelphia founded thecontinental armyand unanimously appointedgeorge washingtonas its commander-in-chief washington then immediately departed philadelphia for boston where he arrived on july 2 1775 and led the newly-formed continental army in the siege fighting was limited to small-scale raids and skirmishes and the continental army faced challenges with a deficiency of munitions and suppliesboston neck then narrow and only approximately 100 feet wide impeded washingtons ability to invade boston which led to a prolonged stalemate between the continental army and british forces a young officerrufus putnam came up with a plan to make portable fortifications out of wood which were erected on the frozen ground under cover of darkness putnam supervised the effort which successfully installed the fortifications and dozens of cannons ondorchester heightsthathenry knoxlaboriously brought through the snow fromfort ticonderoga the following morning the astonished british army awoke to see a large array of cannons bearing down on them general howe is believed to have said that the americans had done more in one night than his british army could have done in six months the british army responded by attempting to launch a cannon barrage for two hours but their shots could not reach the continental armys cannons at such a height the british then gave up boarded their ships and sailed away from boston in what has come to be known as evacuation day which is now celebrated in boston annually on march 17 after the british retreat washington was so impressed with the effort of rufus putnam that he appointed him as his chief engineer 52 53 55 ### post-revolution and the war of 1812 after the revolution bostons longseafaringtradition helped make it one of the nations busiest ports for both domestic and international trade bostons harbor activity was significantly curtailed by theembargo act of 1807 which was adopted during thenapoleonic wars and thewar of 1812 foreign trade returned after these hostilities but bostons merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the meantime manufacturing became an important component of the citys economy and the citys industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century the small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories later a dense network of railroads furthered the regions industry and commerce 56 during this period boston also flourished culturally it was admired for itsrarefied literary lifeand generousartistic patronage 57 58 members of old boston families later dubbed boston brahmins came to be regarded as the nations social and cultural elites 59 they are often associated with theamerican upper classharvard university 60 and theepiscopal church 61 62 boston was a prominent port of theatlantic slave tradein thenew england colonies but was soon overtaken bysalem massachusetts andnewport rhode island 63 boston eventually became a center of theamerican abolitionist movement 64 the city reacted largely negatively to thefugitive slave act of 1850 65 contributing to presidentfranklin pierces attempt to make an example of boston afteranthony burnss attempt to escape to freedom 66 67 in 1822 15 the citizens of boston voted to change the official name from the town of boston to the city of boston and on march 19 1822 the people of boston accepted thecharter incorporating the city 68 at the time boston was chartered as a city the population was about 46226 while the area of the city was only 4.8 sq mi 12 km2 68 ### 19th century in the 1820s

period especially following thegreat famine by 1850 about 35000irish lived in boston 69 in the latter half of the 19th century the city saw increasing numbers of irishgermanslebanese syrians 70 french canadians andrussianandpolish jewssettling there by the end of the 19th century bostons core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants with their residence yielding lasting cultural changeitaliansbecame the largest inhabitants of thenorth end 71 irishdominatedsouth bostonandcharlestown andrussianjewslived in thewest endirishanditalianimmigrants brought with them roman catholicism currently catholics make up bostons largest religious community 72 and the irish have played a major role in boston politics since the early 20th century prominent figures include thekennedystip oneill andjohn f fitzgerald 73 between 1631 and 1890 the city tripled its area throughland reclamationby filling in marshes mud flats and gaps between wharves along the waterfront reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of thesouth end thewest end thefinancial district andchinatown 74 after thegreat boston fire of 1872 workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront during the mid-to-late 19th century workers filled almost 600 acres 240 ha of brackish charles river marshlands west ofboston commonwith gravel brought by rail from the hills of needham heights the city annexed the adjacent towns ofsouth boston 1804 east boston 1836 roxbury 1868 dorchester including present-daymattapanand a portion ofsouth boston

landisdrafted both securities act of 1933 andsecurities exchange act of 1934 the 1st chair of the us securities and exchange commissionjoseph p kennedy srwas from boston 96 kennedy sr had this to say before the boston chamber of commerce on november 15 1934 “the rogues who seek to live by deception-let me again repeat the act is like all legal rules subject to the limitations of effective legal action unfortunately scoundrels will capitalize the registration requirements and may seek to sell you a security on the theory that mere filing indicates approval by the commission beware of any such argument our short experience as to this legislation prompts me to sound a note of warning particularly to you my friends of the radio audience each and everyone of you is a prospective or actual member of a sucker list and when the stranger calls you on the phone to interest you in the purchase of securities beware” 97 by the early- to mid-20th century boston declined economically as factories became old and obsolete and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere 98 boston responded by initiating variousurban renewalprojects under the direction of theboston redevelopment authority bra established in 1957 in 1958 bra initiated a project to improve the historic west end neighborhood extensive demolition was met with strong public opposition and thousands of families were displaced 99 the bra continued implementingeminent domainprojects including the clearance of the vibrantscollay squarearea for construction of the modernist stylegovernment center in

economic downturn a large number of high-rises were constructed in thefinancial districtand in bostonsback bayduring this period 102 this boom continued into the mid-1980s and resumed after a few

unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s 103 boston has also experiencedgentrificationin the latter half of the 20th century 104 with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s when the citysrent controlregime was struck down by statewideballot proposition 105 ### 21st century boston is an intellectual technological and political center however it has lost some important regional institutions 106 including the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such asfleetboston financial which was acquired bycharlotte-basedbank of americain 2004 107 boston-based department storesjordan marshandfileneshave both merged into thenew york city–basedmacys 108 the 1993 acquisition ofthe boston globebythe new york times 109 was reversed in 2013

april 15 2013 two chechen islamist brothersdetonated a pair of bombsnear the finish line of theboston marathon killing three people and injuring roughly 264 112 the subsequent search for the bombers led to a lock-down of boston and surrounding municipalities the region showed solidarity during this time as symbolized by the sloganboston strong 113 in 2016 boston brieflyshouldered a bidas the us

neighborhoods because of the profusion of diverse subsections 121 122 the city governments office of neighborhood services has officially designated 23 neighborhoods 123 more than two-thirds of inner bostons modern land area did not exist when the city was founded instead it was created via the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries 74 this was accomplished using earth from the leveling or lowering of bostons three original hills the trimountain after which tremont street is named as well as with gravel brought by train from needham to fill theback bay 16 christian science centercopley squarenewbury street and new englands two tallest buildings thejohn hancock towerand theprudential center 124 125 near the john hancock tower is theold john hancock

128 trinity church single-family homes and wooden brick multi-family row houses the south end historic district is the largest surviving contiguous victorian-era neighborhood in the us 129 the

elevatedcentral arteryand incorporated new green spaces and open areas 130 ### environment boston is located within the boston basinecoregion which is characterized by low and rolling hills with a number of ponds lakes and reservoirs forests are mainly transition hardwoods such asoak-hickorymixed withwhite pine 131 as a coastal city built largely onfillsea-level riseis of major concern to the

boston are supported bywooden pilesdriven into the areas fill these piles remain sound if submerged in water but are subject todry rotif exposed to air for long periods 133 groundwaterlevels have been dropping in many areas of the city due in part to an increase in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground the boston groundwater trust coordinates monitoring groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells 134 the city developed a climate action plan coveringcarbon reductionin buildings transportation and energy use the first such plan was commissioned in 2007 with updates released in 2011 2014 and 2019 135 this plan includes the building energy reporting and disclosure ordinance which requires the citys larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and to partake in anenergy assessmentevery five years 136 a separate initiative resilient boston harbor lays out

which can produce large amounts of snow and rain 140 fog is fairly common particularly in spring and early summer due to its coastal location the city often receivessea breezes especially in the late spring when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than 20 °f 11 °c colder than a few miles inland sometimes dropping by that amount near midday 147 148
