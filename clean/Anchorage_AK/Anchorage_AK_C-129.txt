accounting for more than half the states population at 1706sqmi 4420km of land area the city is the fourth-largest by area in the united states and larger than the smallest state rhode island which has 1212sqmi 3140km anchorage is in southcentral alaska at the terminus of the cook inlet on a peninsula formed by the knik arm to the north and the turnagain arm to the south first settled as a tent city near the mouth of ship creek in 1915 when construction on the alaska railroad began anchorage was incorporated as a city in november 1920 in september 1975 the city of anchorage merged with the greater anchorage area borough creating the municipality of anchorage the municipal city limits span 1961.1sqmi 5079.2km encompassing the urban core a joint military base several outlying communities and almost all of chugach state park because of this less than 10% of the municipality or muni is populated with the highest concentration of people in the 100 square-mile area that makes up the city proper on a promontory at the headwaters of the inlet commonly called anchorage the city of anchorage or the anchorage bowl due to its location almost equidistant from new york city tokyo and murmansk russia straight over the north pole anchorage lies within 10 hours by air of nearly 90% of the industrialized world for this reason ted stevens anchorage international airport is a common refueling stop for international cargo flights and home to a major fedex hub which the company calls a critical part of its global network of services anchorage has won the all-america city award four times in 1956 1965 1984â€“85 and 2002 from the national civic league kiplinger has named it the united states most tax-friendly city history archaeological evidence discovered at beluga point just south of anchorage proper along the turnagain arm suggests that habitation of the cook inlet began 5000 years ago by a group of alutiiq people who arrived by kayak as this population moved on they were followed by a second wave of alutiiq occupation beginning roughly 4000 years ago followed by a third wave around 2000 years ago around 500 ad the chugach alutiiq were displaced by the arrival of denaina athabaskans who entered through the mountain passes the denaina had no fixed settlements migrating throughout the area with the seasonal changes fishing along coastal streams and rivers in the summer hunting moose mountain goats and dall sheep in early fall and picking berries in late fall they tended to winter near trading junctions along common travel routes where they traded with other denaina and ahtna tribes from nearby areas captain james cook was among the first european explorers to map the alaskan coastline and many of the geographical features mountains islands rivers waterways etc still bear the names he gave them cook was searching for the fabled northwest passage a route that would provide a shorter means of reaching the pacific from europe than the difficult northeast passage around the north of asia or south around south america on may 15 1778 after enduring weeks of hard weather cook turned into an inlet between two landmarks he called cape douglas and mount st augustine he anchored his ship hms resolution at a place he called anchor point later named anchorage as another anchor point existed to the south near homer alaska near a creek he dubbed ship creek nestled between two large arms waterways cook spent ten days exploring the inlet named after him he first sent william bligh to scout the north arm where he met with the denaina natives of the eklutna area who told him the name of the knik arm and that it was not the northwest passage but rather an outlet for two rivers the knik and matanuska rivers cook then sailed south to scout the other arm and in a bad mood after running the resolution aground on a sandbar on his way back out of the shallow waters called it river turnagain having found no sign of the passage there either in the 19th century russian presence in south-central alaska was well-established the russians placed trading posts along cook inlet such as the shelikhov-golikov company s post at niteh on the palmer flats between the knik and matanuska rivers which in turn created small agricultural communities in ninilchik seldovia and eklutna the russians also introduced diseases such as smallpox that had devastating effects on the local native population which plummeted by half just 10 years after the first census in 1867 us secretary of state william h seward brokered a deal to purchase alaska from imperial russia for $7.2 million or about two cents an acre $129.1 million in 2023 dollars his political rivals lampooned the deal as sewards folly sewards icebox and walrussia in 1888 gold was discovered along turnagain arm just south of modern-day anchorage leading to a new influx of prospectors and small towns such as spenard hope rainbow bird indian and girdwood began to spring up alaska became an organized incorporated united states territory in 1912 anchorage unlike every other large town in alaska south of the brooks range was neither a fishing nor mining camp the area surrounding anchorage lacks significant economic metal ores a number of denaina settlements existed along knik arm for years by 1911 the families of j d bud whitney and jim st clair lived at the mouth of ship creek and were joined there by a young forest ranger jack brown and his bride nellie in 1912 the city grew from its happenstance choice as a site for railroad construction to begin in 1914 the waters near ship creek were deep enough for barges and small ships to dock and under the direction of frederick mears it became a railroad-construction port for the alaska engineering commission the area near the mouth of ship creek where the railroad headquarters was quickly became a tent city anchorage formed at a time when proponents of prohibition were gaining traction and as part of an effort to stem the flow of the alcohol trade at the direction of president woodrow wilson and with the symmetry of the us army a town site was mapped out on higher ground to the south of the tent city with the condition that a persons land could be repossessed if caught breaking the alcohol laws anchorage has been noted in the years since for its order and rigidity compared with other alaska town sites in 1915 territorial governor john franklin alexander strong encouraged residents to change the citys name to one that had more significance and local associations in the summer of that year residents held a vote to change the citys name a plurality favored the name alaska city but the territorial government ultimately declined to change the citys name anchorage was incorporated on november 23 1920 construction of the alaska railroad continued until its completion in 1923 the citys economy in the 1920s and 1930s centered on the railroad colonel otto f ohlson the swedish -born general manager of the railroad for nearly two decades became a symbol of residents contempt due to the firm control he maintained over the railroads affairs which by extension became control over economic and other aspects of life in alaska between the 1930s and the 1950s the city experienced massive growth as air transportation and the military became increasingly important aviation operations in anchorage commenced along the firebreak south of town todays delaney park strip which residents also used as a golf course an increase in air traffic led to clearing of a site directly east of town site boundaries starting in 1929 this became merrill field which served as anchorages primary airport during the 1930s and 1940s until anchorage international airport superseded it in 1951 merrill field still sees a significant amount of general aviation traffic elmendorf air force base and the united states armys fort richardson were constructed in the 1940s and served as the citys primary economic engine until the 1968 prudhoe bay discovery shifted the thrust of the economy toward the oil industry the good friday earthquake of march 27 1964 hit anchorage hard at a magnitude of 9.2 killing 115 people and causing $116 million in damages $750 million in 2023 dollars the earth-shaking event lasted nearly five minutes most structures that failed remained intact for the first few minutes then failed with repeated flexing it was the worlds fourth-largest earthquake in recorded history broadcaster genie chance has been credited with holding anchorage together as she immediately rushed to the anchorage public safety building and stayed on the keni airwaves for almost 24 continuous hours chance effectively designated as the public safety officer by the citys police chief was instrumental in anchorages relief and recovery efforts as she coordinated response efforts connected urgent needs with available resources disseminated information of available shelters and food sources and passed messages among loved ones over the air reuniting families because the city and surrounding suburban area was built on top ground consisting of glacial silt the prolonged shaking from the earthquake caused soil liquefaction leading to massive cracks in roadways and collapse of large swaths of land one of anchorages most affected residential areas the turnagain neighborhood saw dozens of homes originally at 250 to 300 feet above sea level sink to sea level rebuilding and recovery dominated the remainder of the 1960s in 1968 arco discovered oil in prudhoe bay on the alaska north slope and the resulting oil boom spurred further growth in anchorage in 1975 the city of anchorage and the greater anchorage area borough which includes eagle river girdwood glen alps and several other communities merged into the geographically larger municipality of anchorage the city continued to grow in the 1980s and capital projects and an aggressive beautification campaign took place several attempts have been made to move alaskas state capital from juneau to anchorage or to a site closer to anchorage the motivation is straightforward the railbelt between anchorage and fairbanks contains most of alaskas population robert atwood owner of the anchorage times and a tireless booster for the city championed the move alaskans rejected attempts to move the capital in 1960 and 1962 but in 1974 as alaskas center of population moved away from southeast alaska and to the railbelt voters approved it communities such as fairbanks and much of rural alaska opposed moving the capital to anchorage for fear of concentrating more power in the states largest city as a result in 1976 voters approved a plan to build a new capital city near willow about 70mi 110km north of anchorage in the 1978 election opponents to the move reacted by campaigning to defeat a nearly $1 billion bond issue to fund construction of the new capitol building and related facilities $4 billion in 2023 dollars later attempts to move the capital or the legislature to wasilla north of anchorage also failed anchorage has over twice as many state employees as juneau and is to a considerable extent the center of alaskas state and federal government activity geography anchorage is in southcentral alaska at 61 degrees north it lies slightly farther north than oslo stockholm helsinki and saint petersburg but not as far north as reykjavÃ­k or murmansk it is northeast of the alaska peninsula kodiak island and cook inlet due north of the kenai peninsula northwest of prince william sound and the alaska panhandle and nearly due south of denali the city is on a strip of coastal lowland and extends up the lower alpine slopes of the chugach mountains point campbell the westernmost point of anchorage on the mainland juts out into cook inlet near its northern end at which point it splits into two arms to the south is turnagain arm a fjord that has some of the worlds highest tides knik arm another tidal inlet lies to the west and north the chugach mountains on the east form a boundary to development but not to the city limits which encompass part of the wild alpine territory of chugach state park the citys sea coast consists mostly of treacherous mudflats newcomers and tourists are warned not to walk in this area because of extreme tidal changes and the very fine glacial silt unwary victims have walked onto the solid seeming silt revealed when the tide is out and have become stuck in the mud the two recorded instances of this occurred in 1961 and 1988 according to the united states census bureau the municipality has an area of 1961.1 square miles 5079.2 km 1697.2 square miles 4395.8 km of which is land and 263.9 square miles 683.4 km of it is water the total area is 13.5% water
