hernando de soto in 1541 located on the high chickasaw bluffs the site offered natural protection from mississippi river flooding and became a contested location in the colonial era modern memphis was founded in 1819 by john overton james winchester and andrew jackson the city thrived due to its river traffic and cotton-based economy becoming one of the largest cities in the antebellum south after the american civil war it remained a key hub for the cotton and hardwood industries memphis is also notable for its role in the american civil rights movement dr martin luther king jr was assassinated

it is home to the memphis grizzlies of the nba and several colleges and universities including the university of memphis christian brothers university and rhodes college history early history occupying a substantial bluff rising from the mississippi river the site of memphis has been a natural location for human settlement by varying indigenous cultures over thousands of years in the first millennium ad people of the mississippian culture were prominent the culture influenced a network of communities throughout the mississippi river valley and its tributaries the hierarchical societies built complexes with large earthwork ceremonial and burial mounds as expressions of their sophisticated culture the chickasaw people believed to be their descendants later inhabited this site and a large territory in the southeast spanish explorer hernando de soto encountered the historic chickasaw in this area in the 16th century followed in the 17th century by french explorers led by rené-robert cavelier sieur de la salle j d l holmes writing in hudsons four centuries of southern indians 2007 notes that this site was a third strategic point in the late 18th century through which european powers could control united states encroachment beyond the appalachians and their interference with indian matters—after fort nogales present-day vicksburg and fort confederación present-day epes alabama chickasaw bluffs located on the mississippi river at the present-day location of memphis spain and the united states vied for control of this site which was a favorite of the chickasaws in 1795 the spanish governor-general of louisiana francisco luis héctor de carondelet sent his lieutenant governor manuel gayoso de lemos to negotiate and secure consent from the local chickasaw so that a spanish fort could be erected on the bluff fort san fernando de las barrancas was the result holmes notes that consent was reached despite opposition from disappointed americans and a pro-american faction of the chickasaws when the pro-spanish faction signed the chickasaw bluffs cession and spain provided the chickasaws with a trading post fort san fernando de las barrancas remained a focal point of spanish activity until as holmes summarizes the treaty of san lorenzo or pinckneys treaty of 1795 implemented in march 1797 had as its result that all of the careful diplomatic work by spanish officials in louisiana and west florida which has succeeded for a decade in controlling the indians eg the choctaws was undone the united states gained the right to navigate the mississippi river and won control over the yazoo strip north of the thirty-first parallel the spanish dismantled the fort shipping its lumber and iron to their locations in arkansas in 1796 the site became the westernmost point of the newly admitted state of tennessee in what was then called the southwest united states the area was still largely occupied and controlled by the chickasaw nation captain isaac guion led an american force down the ohio river to claim the land arriving on july 20 1797 by this time the spanish had departed the forts ruins went unnoticed 20 years later when memphis was laid out as a city after the united states government paid the chickasaw for land 19th century at the beginning of the century as recognized by the united states in 1786 treaty of hopewell the land still belonged to the chickasaw nation in the treaty of tuscaloosa signed in october 1818 and ratified by congress on january 7 1819 the chickasaw ceded their territory in western tennessee to the united states the city of memphis was founded less than five months after the us takeover of the territory on may 22 1819 incorporated december 19 1826 by john overton james winchester and andrew jackson they named it after the ancient capital of egypt on the nile river from the citys foundation onwards african americans formed large proportion of memphis population prior to the abolition of slavery in the united states most black people in memphis were enslaved being used as forced labor by white enslavers along the river or on outlying cotton plantations in the mississippi delta the citys demographics changed dramatically in the 1850s and 1860s due to waves of immigration and domestic migration due to increased immigration since the 1840s and the great famine irish americans made up 9.9% of the population in 1850 but 23.2% by 1860 when the total population was 22623 tennessee seceded from the union in june 1861 and memphis briefly became a confederate stronghold union ironclad gunboats captured it in the naval battle of memphis on june 6 1862 and the city and state were occupied by the union army for the duration of the war union commanders allowed the city to maintain its civil government during most of this period but excluded confederate states army veterans from office this shifted political dynamics in the city as the war went on the war years contributed to additional dramatic changes in the city population the union armys presence attracted many fugitive slaves who had escaped from surrounding rural plantations so many sought protection behind union lines that the army set up contraband camps to accommodate them memphiss black population increased from 3000 in 1860 when the total population was 22623 to nearly 20000 in 1865 with most settling south of the city limits postwar years reconstruction and democratic control the rapid demographic changes added to the stress of war and occupation and uncertainty about who was in charge increasing tensions between the citys ethnic irish policemen and black union soldiers after the war in three days of rioting in early may 1866 the memphis riots erupted in which white mobs made up of policemen firemen and other mostly ethnic irish americans attacked and killed 46 blacks wounding 75 and injuring 100 raped several women and destroyed nearly 100 houses while severely damaging churches and schools in south memphis much of the black settlement was left in ruins two whites were killed in the riot many blacks permanently fled memphis afterward especially as the freedmens bureau continued to have difficulty in protecting them their population fell to about 15000 by 1870 37.4% of the total population of 40226 historian barrington walker suggests that the irish rioted against blacks because of their relatively recent arrival as immigrants and the uncertain nature of their own claim to whiteness they were trying to distinguish themselves from blacks in the underclass the main fighting participants were ethnic irish decommissioned black union soldiers and newly emancipated african-american freedmen walker suggests that most of the mob was not in direct economic conflict with the blacks as by then the irish had attained better jobs but were establishing social and political dominance over the freedmen unlike the disturbances in some other cities ex-confederate veterans were generally not part of the attacks against blacks in memphis as a result of the riots in memphis and a similar one in new orleans louisiana in september congress passed the reconstruction act and the fourteenth amendment to the us constitution yellow fever epidemics in the 1870s a series of yellow fever epidemics devastated memphis with the disease carried by river passengers traveling by ships along the waterways during the yellow fever epidemic of 1878 more than 5000 people were listed in the official register of deaths between july 26 and november 27 the vast majority died of yellow fever making the epidemic in the city of 40000 one of the most traumatic and severe in urban us history within four days of the memphis board of healths declaration of a yellow fever outbreak 20000 residents fled the city the ensuing panic left the poverty-stricken the working classes and the african-american community at the most risk from the epidemic those who remained relied on volunteers from religious and physician organizations to tend to the sick by the end of the year more than 5000 were confirmed dead in memphis the new orleans health board listed not less than 4600 dead the mississippi valley recorded 120000 cases of yellow fever with 20000 deaths the $15 million in losses caused by the epidemic bankrupted memphis and as a result its charter was revoked by the state legislature by 1870 memphiss population of 40000 was almost double that of nashville and atlanta and it was the second-largest city in the south after new orleans its population continued to grow after 1870 even when the panic of 1873 hit the us hard particularly in the south the panic of 1873 resulted in expanding memphiss underclasses amid the poverty and hardship it wrought giving further credence to memphis as a rough shiftless city leading up to the outbreak in 1878 it had suffered two yellow fever epidemics cholera and malaria giving it a reputation as sickly and filthy it was unheard of for a city with a population as large as memphiss not to have any waterworks the city still relied for supplies entirely on collecting water from the river and rain cisterns and had no way to remove sewage the combination of a swelling population especially of lower and working classes and abysmal health and sanitary conditions made memphis ripe for a serious epidemic kate bionda an owner of an italian snack house died of a fever on august 13 1878 hers was officially reported by the board of health on august 14 as the first case of yellow fever in the city a massive panic ensued the same trains and steamboats that had brought thousands into memphis in five days carried away more than 25000 refugees more than half of the citys population on august 23 the board of health finally declared a yellow fever epidemic in memphis and the city collapsed hemorrhaging its population in july of that year the city had a population of 47000 by september 19000 remained and 17000 of them had yellow fever the only people left in the city were the lower classes such as german and irish immigrant workers and african americans none had the means to flee the city as did the middle and upper-class whites of memphis and thus they were subjected to a city of death immediately following the board of healths declaration a citizens relief committee was formed by charles g fisher it organized the city into refugee camps the committees main priority was to separate the poor from the city and isolate them in refugee camps the howard association formed specifically for yellow fever epidemics in new orleans and memphis organized nurses and doctors in memphis and throughout the country they stayed at the peabody hotel the only hotel to keep its doors open during the epidemic from there they were assigned to their respective districts physicians of the epidemic reported seeing as many as 100 to 150 patients daily the episcopal community of st mary at st marys episcopal cathedral played an important role during the epidemic in caring for the lower classes already supporting a girls school and church orphanage the sisters of st mary also sought to provide care for the canfield asylum a home for black children each day they alternated caring for the orphans at st marys delivering children to the canfield asylum and taking soup and medicine on house calls to patients between september 9 and october 4 sister constance and three other nuns fell victim to the epidemic and died they later became known as the martyrs of memphis at long last on october 28 a killing frost struck the city sent out word to memphians scattered all over the country to come home though yellow fever cases were recorded in the pages of elmwood cemeterys burial record as late as february 29 1874 the epidemic seemed quieted the board of health declared the epidemic at an end after it had caused over 20000 deaths and financial losses of nearly $200 million on november 27 a general citizens meeting was called at the greenlaw opera house to offer thanks to those who had stayed behind to serve of whom many had died over the next year property tax revenues collapsed and the city could not make payments on its municipal debts as a result memphis temporarily lost its city charter and was reclassified by the state legislature as a taxing district from 1878 to 1893 but a new era of sanitation was developed in the city a new municipal government in 1879 helped form the first regional health organization and during the 1880s memphis led the nation in sanitary reform and improvements perhaps the most significant effect of yellow fever on memphis was in demographic changes nearly all of memphiss upper and middle classes vanished depriving the city of its general leadership and class structure that dictated everyday life similar to that in other large southern cities such as new orleans charleston south carolina and atlanta georgia in memphis the poorer whites and blacks fundamentally made up the city and played the greatest role in rebuilding it the epidemic had resulted in memphis being a less cosmopolitan place with an economy that served the cotton trade and a population drawn increasingly from poor white and black southerners late 19th century the 1890 election was strongly contested resulting in white opponents of the d p hadden faction working to deprive them of votes by disenfranchising blacks the state had enacted several laws including the requirement of poll taxes that made it more difficult for them to register to vote and served to disenfranchise many blacks although political party factions in the future sometimes paid poll taxes to enable blacks to vote african americans lost their last positions on the city council in this election and were forced out of the police force they did not recover the ability to exercise the franchise until after the passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s historian l b wrenn suggests the heightened political hostility of the democratic contest and related social tensions contributed to a white mob lynching three black grocers in memphis in 1892 journalist ida b wells of memphis investigated the lynchings as one of the men killed was a friend of hers she demonstrated that these and other lynchings were more often due to economic and social competition than any criminal offenses by black men her findings were considered so controversial and aroused so much anger that she was forced to move away from the city but she continued to investigate and publish the abuses of lynching businessmen were eager to increase the city population after the losses of 1878–79 and supported the annexation of new areas this measure was passed in 1890 before the census the annexation measure was finally approved by the state legislature through a compromise achieved with real estate magnates and the area annexed was slightly smaller than first proposed in 1893 the city was rechartered with home rule which restored its ability to enact taxes the state legislature established a cap rate although the commission government was retained and enlarged to five commissioners democratic politicians regained control from the business elite the commission form of government was believed effective in getting things done but because all positions were elected at-large requiring them to gain majority votes this practice reduced representation by candidates representing significant minority political interests 20th century business in terms of its economy memphis developed as the worlds largest spot cotton market and the worlds largest hardwood lumber market both commodity products of the mississippi delta into the 1950s it was also the worlds largest mule market these animals were still used extensively for agriculture attracting workers from southern rural areas as well as new european immigrants from 1900 to 1950 the city increased nearly fourfold in population from 102350 to 396000 residents racist violence continued into the 20th century with four lynchings between 1900 and the lynching of thomas williams in 1928 a tennessee powder company built an explosives powder plant to make tnt and gunpowder on a 6000-acre site in millington in 1940 the plant was built to make smokeless gunpowder for the british armed forces during world war ii in may 1941 dupont 1802–2017 took over the plant changed the name to the chickasaw ordnance works and produced powder for the united states armed forces there were 8000 employees the plant was dismantled after the war in 1946 politics the crump machine from the 1910s to about 1950 memphis politics was controlled by e h boss crump crump worked with the citys middle class progressive leadership he built up the police and fire departments -- and for decades routinely called on off-duty policemen and firemen to help him out on election day he built up public schools and reorganized city government for more efficiency most progressives in the south were hostile to african american interests but not crump he worked closely with black ministers and he raised funds from business that paid the poll taxes for blacks which enabled them to vote crump had his limits he avoided the demand for prohibition by baptist activists and tolerated the citys thriving saloons and houses of prostitution crump served briefly in congress which gave him a good view of the national picture he was an early supporter of new york governor franklin d roosevelt for the presidency in 1932 crump strongly supported president roosevelt in memphis and statewide and fdr responded with giving crump control of many patronage opportunities he gained a state law in 1911 to establish a small commission to manage the city the city retained a form of commission government until 1967 and patronage flourished under crump the city installed a revolutionary sewer system and upgraded sanitation and drainage to prevent another epidemic pure water from an artesian well was discovered in the 1880s securing the citys water supply the commissioners developed an extensive network of parks and public works as part of the national city beautiful movement lynette wrenn concludes the new system handled business efficiently however it tended toward policies that benefited the citys wealthier residents while sometimes overlooking the needs of its less affluent neighborhoods lynette boney wrenn 1998 crisis and commission government in memphis university of tennessee

provide home rule for cities and counties before that the city had to get state bills approved in order to change its charter and other policies and programs since 1963 it can change the charter by popular approval of the electorate during the 1960s the city was at the center of the civil rights movement as its large african-american population had been affected by state segregation practices and disenfranchisement in the early 20th century african-american residents drew from the civil rights movement to improve their lives in 1968 the memphis sanitation strike began for living wages and better working conditions the workers were overwhelmingly african american they marched to gain public awareness and support for their plight the danger of their work and the struggles to support families with their low pay their drive for better pay had been met with resistance by the city government martin luther king jr of the southern christian leadership conference known for his

the officers were fired and charged with second-degree murder aggravated kidnapping and other crimes the relatively rapid dismissal and prosecution of the offending officers were favorably perceived by nicholss family and davis called it a blueprint for future incidents of police brutality nationwide the incident also resulted in the disbanding of the citys scorpion unit which had been mandated

politics beginning in 1963 memphis adopted a mayor-council form of government with 13 city council members six elected at-large from throughout the city and seven elected from geographic districts following passage of the voting rights act of 1965 civil rights activists challenged the at-large electoral system in court because it made it more difficult for the minority to elect candidates of their choice at-large voting favored candidates who could command a majority across the city in 1995 the city adopted a new plan the 13 council positions are elected from nine geographic districts seven are single-member districts and two elect three members each paul young a democrat is the citys mayor he took office on january 1 2024 since the late 20th century regional discussions have recurred on the concept of consolidating unincorporated shelby county and memphis into a metropolitan government as nashville-davidson county did in 1963 consolidation was a referendum item on the 2010 ballots in both the city of memphis and shelby county under the state law for dual-voting on such measures the referendum was controversial in both jurisdictions black leaders including then-shelby county commissioner joe ford and national civil rights leader al sharpton opposed the consolidation according to the plaintiffs expert marcus pohlmann these leaders tried to turn that referendum into a civil rights issue suggesting that for blacks to vote for consolidation was to give up hard-won civil rights victories of the past in october 2010 before the vote eight shelby county citizens had filed a lawsuit in federal court against the state and the shelby county elections commission against the dual-voting requirement plaintiffs argued that total votes for the referendum should have been counted together rather than as separate elections city voters narrowly supported the measure for consolidation with 50.8% in favor county voters overwhelmingly voted against the measure with 85% against the state argued that with the election decided the lawsuit should be dismissed but the federal court disagreed by late 2013 in pre-trial actions both sides were trying to disqualify the others experts in discussions of whether regional voting revealed racial polarization and whether voting on the referendum demonstrated racial bloc voting the experts for both sides have clashed on whether racial bloc voting is inevitable in local elections and whether that would require some kind of court remedy the defendants expert todd donovan did not think that polarized voting as revealed for political candidates meant that african-american voters and white voters have polarized interests when it comes to referendum choices on government administration taxation service provision and other policy questions he noted in the absence of distinct political interests that create polarized blocs of referendum voters defined by race there is no cohesive racial minority voting interest that can be diluted by a referendum in 2014 the federal district court dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that the referendum would have failed when both jurisdictions votes were counted together in total voting 64% of voters opposed the consolidation in the last week of december 2014 the us sixth district court of appeals upheld that decision ruling that in this election the referendum for consolidation did not pass and would not have passed even if there had been no dual-majority vote requirement with the vote counts combined before the referendum the decision was made by the city and county to exclude public school management and operations from the proposed consolidation as noted below in 2011 the memphis city council voted to dissolve its city school board and consolidate with the shelby county school system without the collaboration or agreement of shelby county the city had authority for this action under tennessee state laws that differentiate
